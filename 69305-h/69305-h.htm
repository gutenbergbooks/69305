<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
INTRODUCTORY
</h3>

<p>
Dante Gabriel, or, to give him his full
christening name, Gabriel Charles Dante
Rossetti, was born on May 12th, 1828, at
No. 38, Charlotte Street, Portland Place, and was
the second of four children, born in successive
years.  Gabriele Rossetti, his father, was a native
of the city of Vasto, in the province of Abruzzi.
He was a man of superior ability and force of
character, and was at one time custodian of
bronzes at the Naples Museum; but having made
himself obnoxious to the Bourbon King Ferdinand
during the suppression of the constitution
in 1821, he was in consequence proscribed and
obliged to fly for safety.  Assisted by a British
man-of-war in escaping to Malta, Gabriele Rossetti
remained there for some time, practising as an
instructor in his native language, until further
annoyance drove him in 1824 to England.  Here
he settled, and obtained an appointment as
Professor of Italian at King's College.  Meantime,
in 1826, he had married a daughter of Gaetano
Polidori, for some while secretary to the notable
Count Alfieri, and father of that strange being,
Dr. John Polidori, who travelled with Byron as
his physician, and committed suicide in 1821.
Gaetano Polidori's wife, Rossetti's grandmother,
was an Englishwoman, whose maiden name was
Pierce.  To his parentage the young Gabriel
was indebted for much, but especially to his
mother.  One can judge of the latter's quiet
sensible character, and deep religious instincts,
from the portraits left us by her son.  But, besides
these qualities, she possessed good literary and
artistic judgement, shrewd knowledge of human
nature, and a fund of common sense which was
strong enough to prevent the somewhat mystical
spirit pervading the thoughts of her young family
from deteriorating into morbid and unhealthy
channels.  Between D. G. Rossetti and his
mother the warmest and most affectionate relations
prevailed, relations that were only severed
by the former's untimely death on April 9th,
1882.  Mrs. Rossetti survived her son exactly
four years to the very day.  Her husband had
died in April, 1854, honoured at the last as a
patriot in his native land.  Their elder daughter,
Maria, departed this life in 1876, and in December,
1894, Christina Rossetti also died, leaving
as sole survivor of this brilliant family the younger
son, William Michael, well known as a literary
critic and as the biographer of his more famous
brother.
</p>

<p>
Albeit English in its main external features,
the environment of the Rossetti family in London
remained essentially Italian during their father's
lifetime.  Gabriele Rossetti was a commentator on
Dante, and himself a writer of verse, mainly in
a politico-patriotic vein.  To the ears of the
young Gabriel, familiarized by habit with the
sonorous metres of the "Inferno" and "Paradiso,"
the name of Dante for many years conjured
up no very stimulating thoughts.  It was not
until he had begun as a young man to read upon
his own lines, that the pictorial richness and
splendour of the Florentine dawned on him and
seized him with its spell.  "The 'Convito,'" he
says, "was a name of dread to us, as being the
very essence of arid unreadableness,"&mdash;an
interesting fact to remember when dealing, as we
shall presently have to do, with the influence
which Dante was destined afterwards to exert
upon two members at least of the family.
</p>

<p>
Reared in this studious atmosphere, however,
it is not to be wondered at that the young Rossettis
early took to literature.  Before they were six
years old they had made acquaintance with Shakespeare
and Scott, in addition to the usual works
of childhood, and were steeped in romance of a
more lofty kind than is common at such an age.
</p>

<p>
Of Rossetti's early literary efforts it is sufficient
to mention two: "The Slave," a bombastic
drama in blank verse, which occupied his faculties
at the age of five, and "Sir Hugh the Heron,"
a legendary poem founded on a tale by Allan
Cunningham.  These two productions do not
sum up the juvenile work of Rossetti of which a
record has been kept, but they are quite as much
as it is fair to mention, and serve sufficiently to
show the romantic drift of his earliest ideas.  In
art he was scarcely less precocious; a pretty story
being told of a milkman, who came upon him in
the passage sketching his rocking-horse, and
expressed considerable surprise at having seen
"a baby making a picture."  Drawings of this
date exist, and also later ones done when he was
in the habit of preparing illustrations for books
he read and for his own romances.  In point of
quality, however, these juvenile sketches are not
to be compared with those of many masters of the
brush who began early, for example with those
of Millais, and are chiefly interesting in
connection with a statement of his brother that "he
could not remember any date at which it was
not an understood thing in the family that
Gabriel was to be a painter."
</p>

<p>
In 1837, after a short preliminary training at
a private school, Dante Gabriel was admitted to
King's College, where his father was Italian
professor.  His artistic training did not begin
until 1841 or 1842, when he left school, and
entered himself at a drawing academy known in
those days as "Sass's," and kept by Mr. F. S. Gary,
son of the translator of Dante.  He remained
some four years at Gary's Academy, during which
period he seems to have acquired the bare
rudiments of his art and to have made a small
reputation for eccentricity.  In July, 1846, having
sent in the requisite probation-drawings, he was
admitted to the Antique School of the Royal
Academy.  His first appearance is graphically
delineated by a fellow-student, whose observant
eye has preserved for us a probably accurate
conception of the fiery young enthusiast:
</p>

<p>
"Thick, beautiful, and closely-curled masses
of rich brown much-neglected hair fell about an
ample brow, and almost to the wearer's shoulders;
strong eyebrows marked with their dark shadows
a pair of rather sunken eyes, in which a sort of
fire, instinct with what may be called proud
cynicism, burned with furtive energy.  His rather
high cheekbones were the more observable because
his cheeks were roseless and hollow enough
to indicate the waste of life and midnight oil
to which the youth was addicted.  Close shaving
left bare his very full, not to say sensuous lips,
and square-cut masculine chin.  Rather below
the middle height, and with a slightly rolling
gait, Rossetti came forward among his fellows
with a jerky step, tossed the falling hair back
from his face, and, having both hands in his
pockets, faced the student world with an <i>insouciant</i>
air which savoured of thorough self-reliance.
A bare throat, a falling, ill-kept collar, boots not
over familiar with brushes, black and well-worn
habiliments, including not the ordinary jacket
of the period, but a loose dress-coat which had
once been new&mdash;these were the outward and
visible signs of a mood which cared even less for
appearances than the art-student of those days
was accustomed to care, which undoubtedly was
little enough."
</p>

<p>
As a student in the dry atmosphere of the
Academy Antique School Rossetti proved a
failure, and never passed to the higher grades
of the Life and Painting classes.  Conventional
methods of study were distasteful to him, and
the traditions of the Academy were especially
arid and cramping to the imagination.  It will
be necessary later on to give some description
of the state into which the art of painting had
fallen in England before the fresh minds of the
young romantic school, breaking away under
Rossetti's leadership, caused such a turmoil and
revolution; but in the meantime, at the period
we are dealing with, it is probably correct to say
that Rossetti grew tired of, rather than
disapproved of, the teaching in the school, that he
was full of ideas craving utterance on canvas,
and that he wanted to paint before he could
properly draw.  This impatience caused him to
take a momentous and curious step, which
certainly entailed harm to him as a technical
executant, though it may indirectly have furthered
his career as an artist.  He decided to throw up
the Academy training, and wrote to a painter of
whom not many people at that date had heard,
but whose work he himself admired, asking to
be admitted into his studio as a pupil.  This was
Ford Madox Brown, and for his own particular
needs and line of thought Rossetti could have
lighted upon no man more absolutely suitable.
Madox Brown was only seven years Rossetti's
senior, but he had studied abroad at Ghent,
Antwerp, Paris, and Rome, and had exhibited
during the early forties some fine cartoon
designs for the decoration of the new House of
Lords.  The pictures by Brown which Rossetti
had seen, and which he mentioned in writing,
were the <i>Giaour's Confession</i>, exhibited at the
Academy in 1841, <i>Parisina</i> (1845), <i>Our Lady of
Saturday Night</i>, and <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i>, of
which he remarked, "if ever I do anything in
art, it will certainly be attributable to a constant
study of that work."  This, and other rather florid
compliments of the same sort, may well have
impressed Madox Brown, who was not accustomed
to be complimented, with a shrewd idea that he
was being made fun of; and the story has been
told how, in a suspicious frame of mind, he armed
himself with a stick and went forth to seek his
unknown correspondent.  On arriving at the
house he was partly reassured by a door-plate;
and the evident sincerity and enthusiasm of
the boy himself, when they met, overcame his
generous warm-heartedness, and made him agree
to take Rossetti into his studio, and to teach him
painting, not for a fee, which he declined, but
for the sheer pleasure of encountering and training
up a sympathetic spirit.
</p>

<p>
Before following his fortunes further in this
direction we must go back and note what
Rossetti's activities in literature had amounted
to during this period.  These are no less than
astonishing.  To take the greatest first, they
include the bulk of the verse translations from the
early Italian poets, first published in 1861, and
afterwards republished under the altered title of
"Dante and his Circle."  Although worked on
and revised from time to time, these translations
remain in all essentials much as Rossetti compiled
them between the years 1845 and 1849, and they
rank among the finest work of the kind in the
English language, being no less remarkable for
their high poetic qualities than for the subtle
dexterity of phrase by which the sound and sense
of the originals have been transplanted into a
naturally colder tongue.  Rossetti's translation of
the "Vita Nuova" alone might stand as a monument
of industry in such a case, for it breathes
a new spirit of language, a voluptuous and exotic
style such as has never been excelled for conveying
the emotional mysticism and introspective
sentiment of a southern lover; but to this he
added that great mass of verse translations and
sonnets, involving many days spent over musty
volumes at the British Museum.  Even this was
not all, for between the same years he began
a translation in verse of the Nibelungenlied,
and finished a translation of von Aue's "Arme
Heinrich," which has been thought worthy of a
place amongst his collected works.  Besides these,
in 1847, before he was nineteen years old, he
had written his best-known poem, "The Blessed
Damozel," together with several others, including,
"My Sister's Sleep," "The Portrait," and
considerable portions of "Ave," "A Last
Confession," and the "Bride's Prelude."  The
performance of these literary efforts is so finished,
the sentiment so profound and mature, that one
can hardly understand the ambition which kept
painting in the foremost place and made poetry
the <i>parergon</i>.  The ease with which versification
came to Rossetti may have blinded him at first
to the merits of his work in this art, as happened
later in the case of William Morris; but however
that may be, he was not encouraged to abandon
painting as a means of livelihood, and having
made the arrangement already described with
Madox Brown, he settled down with a characteristic
mixture of enthusiasm and despair to the
pursuit of art.
</p>

<p>
Much as he owed to him in the way of instruction
and sympathetic encouragement, Rossetti
did not remain long in Brown's studio, at all
events as a regular attendant, but left him after
a few months to share a studio with Mr. Holman
Hunt.  The beginning of this intimacy was curious
and typical.  On the opening day of the Academy
Exhibition (May, 1848) "Rossetti," says
Mr. Hunt, "came up boisterously and in loud tongue
made me feel very confused by declaring that
mine was the best picture of the year.  The fact
that it was from Keats (the picture was <i>The Eve of
St. Agnes</i>) made him extra-enthusiastic, for I think
no painter had ever before painted from this
wonderful poet, who then, it may scarcely be credited,
was little known."  Rossetti begged to be allowed
to visit Hunt, for at the Academy schools they had
barely been acquainted, and, as an upshot of the
acquaintance, agreed to work for a time with
him, sharing for this purpose a studio which the
latter had just taken in Cleveland Street, Fitzroy
Square.  Here (as well as later in a studio which
he took for himself at 83, Newman Street)
Brown, whose friendship continued to the end
of Rossetti's life, visited him from time to time,
and gave him the benefit of his advice; and here,
amid what Mr. Hunt has described as the most
dismal and dingy surroundings, Rossetti began
to paint his first real picture.  The year 1848
marks his transition artistically from boyhood to
adolescence, an adolescence in which depth of
feeling and height of aspiration transcended the
power of accomplishment, and no artificial
mannerisms obscured the seriousness of purpose that
characterized, not him alone, but the whole of
the small band of workers with which he presently
became associated.  The formation of this band,
and the painting of Rossetti's first picture, bring
us to the story of the famous Pre-Raphaelite
movement, and will more properly serve to begin
a new, than to end a preliminary chapter.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
THE "PRE-RAPHAELITE BROTHERHOOD"
</h3>

<p>
In relating afresh the history of the
"Pre-Raphaelite" movement, one has many
precedents to choose from.  According to the point
of view selected one may see in it the conscious
expression of a great artistic revival, deliberately
planned by a body of zealots, and based upon a
structure of lofty principles; or one may go to
the opposite extreme and regard it merely as an
exuberant freak, an irresponsible outburst on the
part of a few impulsive youths linked together
for one brief moment by a mutual combination
of enthusiasm and high spirits.  For both of these
points of view ample authority might be quoted,
and the truth as usual lies somewhere safe
between them.
</p>

<p>
The tendency has been, on the whole, not
unnaturally, to exaggerate the significance of the
"Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood," which after all
was but the grain of mustard seed from which a
great tree sprung.  Its formation came about in
the following way.  We have noted the somewhat
sudden alliance between Rossetti and Holman
Hunt, and their plan of sharing a studio to carry
out work in common.  Through Hunt, Rossetti
had become acquainted with Millais, and had
joined, or helped to start, a "Cyclographic
Society," numbering several members, to wit,
Thomas Woolner, F. G. Stephens, Walter
Deverell, John Hancock the sculptor, James
Collinson, William Dennis, J. B. Keene, and
some four or five besides.  The scheme was for
members to contribute drawings to a portfolio
which was sent round for all the rest to criticise.
Like other institutions based upon mutual candour,
this society enjoyed a very brief existence,
and was mainly of service in weeding out those
who did not sympathize with the new ideas which
were ripening in Rossetti and his friends from
those who did.  The final development of these
ideas was brought about by a meeting at Millais's
home in Gower Street, where the three alighted
upon a volume of engravings after the frescoes
in the Campo Santo at Pisa.  Ruskin has spoken
scornfully of this work as "Lasinio's execrable
engravings," but whatever their quality they at
least served to show that in the earlier men, who
preceded Raphael, there was a feeling for earnest
work, a striving after lofty expression, which was
worth more as an inspiration than the stereotyped
fashion of painting which had come into vogue
in England.  Why this mechanical cult should
ever have become grafted on to the ill-used name
of Raphael, and shadowed by his stately fame,
is a difficult matter to explain, and requires an
excursus into the history of European art.  Its
effect on the teaching of the day, however, is
summed up in the following incisive passage by
Ruskin:
</p>

<p>
"We begin, in all probability, by telling the
youth of fifteen or sixteen that Nature is full of
faults, and that he is to improve her; but that
Raphael is perfection, and that the more he
copies Raphael the better; that after much
copying of Raphael, he is to try what he can do
himself in a Raphaelesque, but yet original
manner: that is to say, he is to try to do something
very clever, all out of his own head, but yet
this clever something is to be properly subjected
to Raphaelesque rules, is to have a principal
light occupying one-seventh of its space, and a
principal shadow occupying one-third of the
same; that no two people's heads in the picture
are to be turned the same way, and that all the
personages represented are to have ideal beauty
of the highest order, which ideal beauty consists
partly in a Greek outline of a nose, partly in
proportions expressible in decimal fractions between
the lips and chin; but partly also in that degree
of improvement which the youth of sixteen is to
bestow upon God's work in general."
</p>

<p>
This canting and misdirected worship of
Raphael by men who had discarded his spirit,
and the realization that before Raphael there
were painters of lofty aim, may well have determined
the title under which the three enthusiasts
conspired to band themselves in revolt.  From
most points of view it was unfortunate.  It meant
very little in actual fact, it was misleading so far
as it did mean anything, and it was responsible
for much of the acrimony and abuse which the
devoted trio afterwards brought down upon their
most meritorious efforts.  One curious feature of
the matter is that they appear to have possessed
between them at this time a comparatively slight
acquaintance with pre-Raphaelite pictures, not
more, perhaps, than the average intelligent visitor
to the National Gallery to-day.  Scarcely
anywhere in their writings (we must except one
article by Mr. F. G. Stephens) do we find
praise, or even mention, of most of the great
pre-Raphaelite painters.  Nothing of Mantegna,
Botticelli, Bellini, Orcagna, Fra Angelico,
Melozzo, Lippo Lippi, or Piero della Francesca.
At a slightly later date Rossetti visited Bruges,
and fell in love with Memling; but his letters
even then reveal some very crude preferences in
art.  Whatever was perceived or imagined in the
work of the men they decided to follow must
have been largely a matter of instinct, backed up
by a strong sympathy for the naïve and simple
charm of the few early Italian pictures which
they had seen.  It is a mistake to suppose that
what Rossetti and his companions admired or
sought to imitate in these old masters was their
mediaeval and primitive style of painting.  The
mediaeval quality proved infectious, no doubt,
and may have influenced all more or less at first
in the direction of angularity and awkward
composition.  But there were other causes which also
contributed to this.  Amongst them may be
mentioned an idea that for every scene an actual
unidealized room or landscape must be painted,
and the figures grouped without reference to
arrangement; also that for each figure a definite
model must be taken and followed even to the
extent of blemishes.  This counsel of perfection,
if it was ever seriously accepted, was certainly
not followed even from the first; but the fact of
its proposal shows the austere lines upon which
these youthful painters proceeded, and helps to
explain what many people have found a stumbling-block,
the lack of grace and harmony in some of
their earliest compositions.  What they sought to
follow in the old Italian models, however, with
all their archaism and immaturity of skill was the
honest striving after nature, sincerity of style,
decorative simplicity, and, by no means least, the
pious selection of worthy subjects.  It is this last
quality, exhibited alike by all the members of the
Brotherhood, that more plainly than anything
marks the cleavage between their "pre-Raphaelite"
work and the commonplace painting of the day.
They set themselves to paint great and ennobling
subjects, often greater than they could achieve,
out of their imagination, when the rest of the
world (always excepting men like Madox Brown,
who belonged to them in spirit) were painting what
Ruskin calls "'cattle-pieces,' and 'sea-pieces,'
and 'fruit-pieces,' and 'family-pieces'; the eternal
brown cows in ditches, and white sails in squalls,
and sliced lemons in saucers, and foolish faces in
simpers."
</p>

<p>
In the inauguration of the "Brotherhood"
Rossetti took a specially active part, and the title
itself was invented by him.  "Rossetti," says
Mr. Hunt, "with his spirit alike subtle and fiery, was
essentially a proselytiser, sometimes to an almost
absurd degree, but possessed, alike in his poetry
and painting, with an appreciation of beauty of
the most intense quality."  Mr. Hunt adds that
the title of "Pre-Raphaelite" was adopted partly
in a spirit of fun, and, like other names which
have acquired honour, was originally a term of
reproach invented by their enemies.  On this
account they prudently decided to keep it secret,
and to let no outward symbol of their union
appear beyond the mystic initials P.R.B., which
were to be used on all their pictures and in
private intercourse.
</p>

<p>
The next step was to enroll sympathetic fellow
members.  Besides the three founders of the
Brotherhood, Rossetti, Millais, and Holman
Hunt, four more or less active adherents were
enlisted.  Hunt introduced Mr. F. G. Stephens,
who at that time was a painter, but very soon
abandoned art for criticism.  Woolner, the
sculptor, whose contributions to the movement were
mainly poetical, was introduced by Millais, or
possibly Rossetti; and the latter certainly was
responsible for the remaining two recruits, his
brother and James Collinson.  Collinson, a torpid
member at the best, and elected apparently
on the strength of one picture which Rossetti
thought "stunning," was mainly useful as a butt
to the others, who used to make fun of his sleepy
nature and drag him all reluctant from his bed
to go for midnight walks.  Shortly afterwards,
being seized with religious propensities, he
vacated his membership and retired to Stonyhurst.
</p>

<p>
For the doings of the Brotherhood the curious
reader will do well to consult the "Memoirs"
and the "Rossetti Papers" published by
Mr. W. M. Rossetti.  Mr. Rossetti, not being an artist,
was himself elected secretary, and with business-like
care preserved in a diary all the daily and
weekly occurrences that came under his notice.
It is sufficient to say here that the weekly
attendances of the Brethren, at first a constant
source of pleasure and mutual help, had become
very irregular by December, 1850, that an
attempt was made to revive them in January,
1851, but without effect, and that Millais's
election to the Academy in 1853 gave a final
quietus to the organization, which for some time
previously had ceased to exist save in name.
The ranks of the Brotherhood had not even
remained intact.  In addition to Collinson, it had
lost Woolner, who went to Australia when the
emigration craze was at its height.  To replace
the former a young painter, Walter Howell
Deverell, had been nominated, but his election
was regarded by some as invalid.  Deverell, whose
picture of Viola and the Duke in <i>Twelfth Night</i>
remains an almost solitary testimony to his genius,
unhappily died young.  He possessed many
graces of appearance and manner, and was in all
respects a fascinating personality.  Behind the
Brotherhood, and hitherto unmentioned, we seem
to catch a glimpse of another very gracious,
but retiring figure, that of Rossetti's sister
Christina, who in addition to her deeply religious
and poetic gifts, possessed a quiet fund of humour
to be expended on the events that occurred within
her little circle.
</p>

<p>
We left Rossetti, in order to describe the
formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, at
the point where he had just settled down in a
joint studio with Holman Hunt to paint his first
picture.  In an enthusiasm for community of
action, and a spirit of devotion to Keats, it had
been proposed that each of the Brethren should
illustrate, by an etching, a scene from that poet's
"Isabella."  Hunt, however, was already engaged
upon his picture of <i>Rienzi</i>; Millais had work of
a less than Pre-Raphaelite character to finish off,
and Rossetti himself was seized with desire to
paint a subject which much commended itself
to his mystical and symbol-loving mind, <i>The
Girlhood of Mary Virgin</i>.  The only one of the
three eventually, who touched Keats that year
(1848) was Millais, who achieved a triumph with
the striking picture, <i>Lorenzo and Isabella</i>.
</p>

<p>
Rossetti's subject, as can well be imagined, gave
him endless trouble, and was a source of violent
fits of alternate depression and energy.  Madox
Brown's diary, a document full of dry humour
and quaint touches, to say nothing of its pathos,
contains many anecdotes of Rossetti's exasperating
changefulness and want of consideration
which show that kindness did not blind the
painter to his pupil's foibles.  To Brown's
description of Rossetti, "lying, howling, on his
belly in my studio," and, at another time, reduced
by struggles with impossible drapery to an
almost maudlin condition of profanity, we may
add Hunt's description of how he had solemnly
to take his companion out for a walk and explain
that if the interruptions of temper and multiplication
of difficulties did not cease, neither of
them would have a picture finished to show
alongside of Millais's&mdash;a remonstrance which he
says was effectual and taken in perfect good
part.
</p>

<p>
So by the following spring (1849) all three
pictures were ready for exhibition, and were hung,
Millais's and Hunt's in the Academy, and
Rossetti's either from choice or necessity in the
so-called Free Exhibition held in a gallery at
Hyde Park Corner.  Here it was bought for £80
by the Marchioness of Bath, in whose family an
aunt of Rossetti's was acting as governess.  The
picture is on many accounts a favourite one
with lovers of Rossetti's work.  Considering
the painter's age and want of proper training, it
is a masterly performance.  The scene shown is
a room in the Virgin's home, with an open
balcony at which her father, St. Joachim, is
tending a symbolically fruitful vine.  On the
right of the picture, are the figures of the Virgin
and her mother seated at an embroidery frame.
The young girl, a most untypical Madonna, in
simple gray dress with pale green at the wrists,
pauses with a needle in her hand, and gazes with
a rapt ascetic look at the room before her, where,
as if visible to her eyes, a child-angel is tending
a tall white lily.  Beneath the pot in which the
lily grows are six large books bearing the names
of the six cardinal virtues.  These, and a dove
perching on the trellis, are amongst the peaceful
symbols of the picture, whilst the tragedy also is
foreshadowed in a figure of the cross formed by
the young vine-tendrils and in some strips of
palm and "seven-thorned briar" laid across the
floor.  Rossetti painted the calm face of his
mother for St. Anna, and his sister Christina for
the Virgin, giving her, however, in contravention
of the rule mentioned above, golden instead of
dark brown hair.
</p>

<p>
Although 1848 is intrinsically the year of the
Pre-Raphaelite movement, much of the work of
the next two years comes within the scope of its
influence.  As an example may be cited the
important pen-and-ink drawing called <i>Il Saluto di
Beatrice</i>, representing in two compartments the
meeting of Dante and Beatrice, first in a street
of Florence and secondly in Paradise.  The
whole composition was repeated in oil in 1859,
and the meeting in Paradise formed the subject
of more than one separate drawing.  The cream
of Rossetti's Pre-Raphaelite work, however,
during the two years subsequent to 1848, is the
<i>Ecce Ancilla Domini</i>, a sequel in sentiment to
his picture of the previous year.  This is well
known to frequenters of the National Gallery
at Millbank, and is described elsewhere.  It was
exhibited in 1850 under the same auspices as its
predecessor (though the gallery this year was
moved to Portland Place), and was priced at
£50.  Its appearance was the signal for a storm
of abuse and raillery, which descended with
impartial violence also upon the pictures of
the other "Pre-Raphaelites" exhibited at the
Academy, and pursued them relentlessly until
time and success finally established their position.

ECCE ANCILLA DOMINI.
</p>

<p>
It would serve no purpose to go again and at
length into the nature of this attack.  Charles
Dickens and many other great men lent their
names to it, and the Brethren were compelled
to face evil days in consequence.  But in the
darkest hour a saviour appeared.  Ruskin, who before
the outcry hardly knew of the existence of the
school, had his attention drawn to it by Coventry
Patmore, and with characteristic fearlessness and
energy plunged into the fray.  In a series of letters
to the "Times" he defended the artists at all
points, from the charge of being ignorant copyists
and realists, the accusation that they could not
draw, the alleged conspiracy against Raphael, and
finally from the subtlest insinuation of all, because
it sounded so professional, the charge that they
knew not the laws of perspective.  This ardent
championship had one curious effect.  In his
warmth of defence Ruskin had not only combatted
the statement of faults, but had revelled in
laying down an elaborate statement of principles.
Thus it came about that the original ideas out
of which the Brotherhood had grown, ideas of a
broad and possibly nebulous character, became
transmuted into hard and fast rules of conduct
and of practice, which the Brotherhood more or
less had to accept, partly perhaps out of gratitude
to their benefactor, partly because they agreed
with them in theory, and partly because they
may not have seen how far they led.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if we are not to credit the
"Pre-Raphaelites" with all the fine sentiments
attributed to them in Ruskin's inspired defence,
it is absurd to imagine, as some have done, that
they failed to take themselves or their work
seriously because Rossetti in his family letters
used to speak flippantly of his unlucky little
picture, which, like a curse, had come home to
roost.  Men often enough speak lightly to friends
of things which have lain at the heart; and if
Rossetti joked to his brother about "the blessed
eyesore" and "the blessed white daub," it is
none the less true that he had striven to put all
his thoughts and all his knowledge into it, with
such success that it reveals to us to-day an
intensity of feeling and reverence which few
modern painters have emulated, and to which
Rossetti in his later work did not always attain.
</p>

<p>
A characteristic of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood
which has not yet been touched on, and
which here calls for digression, was its remarkable
literary strength.  Of the seven original members,
two&mdash;W. M. Rossetti and Stephens&mdash;were writers
by preference.  The former did not paint at all.
Gabriel Rossetti was, as we have seen, a poet
before he could be called a painter, and a poet
of the first order.  Woolner also was a poet, and
in this capacity alone belonged to the movement.
Collinson made a third; Deverell a weak fourth.
Millais and Hunt showed no inclination this way;
but, besides those mentioned, the coterie included
Christina Rossetti, William Bell Scott, Coventry
Patmore, and Madox Brown, who wrote occasionally
in verse.  Even without the need of a
propaganda such a body was almost bound in
the nature of things to produce literary thought
allied in sentiment with its artistic ideas and
aims.  Hence came about the "Germ," that
much-prized periodical, which had its origin in
the fertile brain of Rossetti, and which was
ostensibly formed to be the organ of the P.R.B.,
and to spread its opinions.  The first number
included "My Sister's Sleep" and the prose
romance, "Hand and Soul," by Rossetti.
Subsequent numbers contained "The Blessed
Damozel," "The Carillon," "Sea Limits" (under
its first title of "From the Cliffs"), and six or
seven sonnets.  Of the four numbers published
the first two only were called "The Germ," the
title in the third and fourth being altered to
"Art and Poetry" at the suggestion of the
Tuppers, who as printers of the magazine had
taken over the responsibility on generous terms.
</p>

<p>
The "Germ," as its brief career sufficiently
denotes, fell almost stillborn upon an ungrateful
world; but amongst a small class of artists and
admirers it undoubtedly served to strengthen
Rossetti's reputation.  There was nothing feeble
or immature about the poetical ideas expressed
in it, and one may even be surprised that such
an original piece of work as the "Blessed
Damozel" did not attract greater attention.  Both
it and "Hand and Soul" have frequently been
reprinted.  The latter is interesting for the light
it throws upon Rossetti's mediaeval and mystical
mind.  To some extent it is an autobiographical
record, a memory of mental perturbations and
experiences which beset the young painter, striving
to preserve and foster the spiritual side of his
nature at the expense of more than commonly
strong bodily inclinations.  From an abstraction
like this story of the mythical young painter
Chiaro dell' Erma we may feel we get one truer
glimpse of the real Rossetti than any number
of life-histories, overlaid with trivial incidents
which obscure rather than reveal his personality,
can give us.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
WORK FROM 1849 TO 1853<br>
INFLUENCE OF BROWNING AND DANTE
</h3>

<p>
Before the first number of the "Germ"
had appeared, and while it was in progress,
Rossetti, accompanied by Holman Hunt, paid
a short and hurried visit to Paris and Belgium.
A rhyming diary and a series of jocular sonnets,
interspersed with a few serious ones, recall the
vigour of his first impressions.  A large proportion
of the time was spent at the Louvre and other
galleries, rushing through Old Masters at a
furious rate.
</p>

<p>
After their return home Rossetti found his
affairs in a bad way.  The failure of the <i>Ecce
Ancilla</i> to find a purchaser at once (it was not sold
until June 1853), and the storm of unfavourable
comment it provoked, caused him frankly to
abandon as unprofitable the mine of
semi-religious, semi-mystical feeling which he had
begun to work, and it was some time before he
could settle down to find another.  Feeling his
way pictorially towards the field of romance in
which his thoughts wandered, he began to
undertake subjects from this class of literature,
from Browning, Dante, Keats, and later from
the "Morte Darthur" of Malory.  His first
experiment was a large canvas illustrating the
page's song in "Pippa Passes," which soon
became impossible and had to be dropped.  The
composition of it remains, however, in a little
painting called <i>Hist, said Kate the Queen</i>, dated
1851.  Two other designs from Browning which
were carried out at this time are a pen-and-ink
drawing from "Sordello" entitled <i>Taurello's
first sight of Fortune</i> and <i>The Laboratory</i>.  The
latter was, in all probability, Rossetti's first
attempt at water-colour (it is painted over a
pen-and-ink drawing, as several of his early ones were),
and bears but slight resemblance either in thought
or execution to the work by which he is popularly
known.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these three subjects, Rossetti
drew or painted in the years 1849-50 other themes
of a romantic and mediaeval nature.  Amongst
them was his first illustration to Shakespeare, a
scene from "Much Ado about Nothing,"
representing the happy lovers, <i>Benedick and Beatrice</i>,
receiving the felicitations of those who had plotted
their match.
</p>

<p>
From the "Vita Nuova" Rossetti took the
incident of <i>Dante drawing an Angel on the
Anniversary of Beatrice's Death</i>, executed first in
pen-and-ink, and originally given to Millais.  A
water-colour of the same subject is of later date, 1853.
The latter was bought by Mr. Thomas Combe,
of the Oxford University Press, and was
bequeathed by his widow to the Taylorian Museum,
where it remains.
</p>

<p>
The "Vita Nuova" also furnished the subject
of a small water-colour of 1849, representing
<i>Beatrice at the Wedding Feast denying her salutation
to Dante</i>.  The poet, with a friend grasping
his arm as if to restrain him, stands watching a
procession of figures clad in blue and green, and
adorned with roses in their hair.  The central
figure of the bridal procession is a portrait of
Miss Elizabeth Eleanor Siddal, who first came
into Rossetti's life at about this date.  She was
the daughter of a Sheffield cutler, and was
employed in a milliner's shop off Leicester Square,
where Walter Deverell discovered her one day
when shopping with his mother.  She was
persuaded to sit to Deverell for his <i>Viola</i>, and
later to Rossetti.  Her portrait also occurs in
a picture by Holman Hunt and in Millais's
<i>Ophelia</i>.
</p>

<p>
Both on account of her romantic history and
her individual attractions, the personality of Miss
Siddal has always exercised a delicate charm over
those who love Rossetti.  She was the model for
most of Rossetti's earliest and finest water-colours
containing women, and probably for all his
Beatrices except the last.
</p>

<p>
To resume the tale of early work, in 1851
Rossetti continued to be engaged on small
subjects of a mediaeval or dramatic character.  We
have, for instance, the charming little group called
<i>Borgia</i>, in which the famous Lucretia is seen
seated with a lute in her hands, to the music
of which two children are dancing.  Over her
shoulders lean on the one side the bloated Pope
Alexander VI, on the other her brother Caesar,
beating time with a knife against a wine-glass on
the table, and blowing the rose-petals from her
hair.  Lucretia's white gown is of ample folds,
with elaborate sleeves, looped up all over with
coloured ribbons and bows, a device which so
took Rossetti's fancy that he repeated it in
<i>Bonifazio's Mistress</i> (1860).
</p>

<p>
In the same year (1851) was produced the
first design for a subject of weird and ghostly
conception, called <i>How they met Themselves</i>.
This depicts a pair of lovers wandering at
twilight in a wood, and suddenly confronted with
their own doubles.  The legend of the Doppelganger
was one of a class of mysterious horrors
which greatly appealed to Rossetti's imagination,
and which fascinated him from boyhood.  Few
but he however would have dared to draw it, and
fewer still could have succeeded with it.  The
first design just referred to, was drawn in
pen-and-ink, and was destroyed or lost at an early
date; but Rossetti redrew it in 1860 whilst at
Paris on his honeymoon, and four years later
painted two water-colour versions.
</p>

<p>
To the year following, 1852, belongs a remarkable
water-colour, representing Giotto painting a
famous portrait of Dante which was discovered
on removing the plaster from the wall of the
Bargello in 1839.  Giotto is in dull red, with
brocaded sleeves turned back.  To his left is
seated Dante, cutting a pomegranate in his hand,
and gazing down with a rapt expression to where
Beatrice is passing in a church procession.
Behind Giotto stands his master, Cimabue, watching
the work which is to eclipse his; and behind
Dante leans his rival, Cavalcanti, holding in his
hand a book of Guinicelli, symbolizing thereby
the three generations of poets.
</p>

<p>
Nothing else of importance is catalogued under
the year 1852, but in 1853 we come to one or
two well-known designs and pictures.  First may
be mentioned the pen-and-ink drawing entitled
<i>Hesterna Rosa</i>, founded upon the plaintive song
of Elena in Sir Henry Taylor's "Philip van
Artevelde":
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Quoth tongue of neither maid nor wife<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To heart of neither wife nor maid,<br>
  'Lead we not here a jolly life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt the shine and shade?'<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Quoth heart of neither maid nor wife<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tongue of neither wife nor maid,<br>
  'Thou wag'st, but I am sore with strife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feel like flowers that fade.'"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The scene represents two gamblers throwing dice,
and their mistresses, one of whom in a fit of shame
is covering her face.  She is the "yesterday's
rose."  The other clasps her arms round the neck
of her lover, and is singing a merry song.  An
innocent little child near by is touching a lute,
and Rossetti has completed the other aspect of
the scene by putting in an ape scratching itself,
a Düreresque touch which he added also in the
little <i>Borgia</i> group.  A water-colour version of
the same subject was painted in 1865, and a
larger version, bearing the title <i>Elena's Song</i>,
was painted in 1871.
</p>

<p>
The starting of <i>Found</i> is one of the most
memorable events in connection with the year
1853.  The subject is a countryman or drover
recognizing in a fallen woman of the streets his
own lost sweetheart.  <i>Found</i> was commissioned
by a Mr. MacCracken, who was also the purchaser
of <i>Ecce Ancilla</i>, in 1853, and several
studies were made for it.  The picture however
was never finished.  "It was," writes
Mr. W. M. Rossetti, "a source of lifelong vexation to my
brother and to the gentlemen, some three or four
in succession, who commissioned him to finish
it."  After his death, Sir Edward Burne-Jones
consented to give a sort of finish to the picture
by washing in blue sky.  In its half-completed
state it passed into the possession of Mr. William
Graham, and after his death it went to America.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
A short note on Rossetti's movements during
the period just covered may be given here.  We
left him in 1848, after a few months' work at
Madox Brown's, sharing a studio with Holman
Hunt in Cleveland Street, Soho, and painting at
the <i>Girlhood of the Virgin</i>.  At the beginning of
1851, he took in common with Deverell the first
floor rooms at No. 17, Red Lion Square&mdash;the
rooms which Morris and Burne-Jones occupied
subsequently from 1856 to 1859, and which
served as a cradle for the famous firm.  In
November, 1852, he took a set of rooms at 14,
Chatham Place, Blackfriars, on a site now cleared
away, overlooking the river and presenting other
advantages.  Here he remained for nearly ten
years, including the brief two years of his married
life, and here he accomplished what many judges
consider the most interesting portion of his work.
He had by now acquired a certain measure of
independence as a painter, which went on
increasing as generous or wealthy patrons
attached themselves.  That his progress was slow,
and that for many years he was reduced to selling
water-colours of priceless beauty for comparatively
trifling sums, was the result partly of a
determination which he formed never to exhibit
his work.  This resolve, which later on became
a sort of mania, is said to have been due in the
first instance to the discouraging reception of
<i>Ecce Ancilla Domini</i> in 1850.  For a long time,
of course, it prevented his being known at all or
appreciated by possible purchasers, and his work
circulated amongst a narrow circle of artistic
friends.  In the days of his greatness it may have
had an opposite effect by arousing curiosity, and
producing a feeling of pique.  Buyers were
attracted towards a man who was notorious for
despising the public eye, and whose work was
spoken of with bated breath as something
supremely precious.  With some few exceptions,
however, it is essential to remember that
Rossetti's work was absolutely unseen by the
public, who became acquainted with him as a
poet long before they knew him even dimly
as a painter.  The effects of this ignorance are
still discernible.  Even after two great
exhibitions of his works in London, and after the
publication of a wide selection from his designs,
there are people who believe that Rossetti never
painted but from one model, and that all his
pictures are distinguished by impossible lips and
a goitrous development of neck.

CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
FRIENDSHIP WITH RUSKIN.&mdash;MARRIAGE,<br>
AND DEATH OF MRS. ROSSETTI
</h3>

<p>
With the year 1854 Rossetti's life entered
upon a new phase.  This was the first
year of his memorable connection with Ruskin.
At the same time he had by now engaged himself
to marry Miss Siddal, whose companionship
and whose health became, for the next eight
years, the most absorbing facts in his private life.
To speak of Ruskin first, his was no ordinary
friendship, but a curious combination of patron,
friend, and mentor.  If Rossetti had been a
common man, living an ordinary life and working
on regular lines, such a connection would have
been, as he jocularly described it once, "in a
way to make his fortune."  For Ruskin was willing
to buy within certain limits almost everything
that Rossetti produced.  Furthermore, having
taken a great fancy to Miss Siddal, and admiring
her poetic and artistic gifts, which had grown in
a remarkable way under Rossetti's tuition, he
tried to make an arrangement whereby he should
purchase all her work also, and there is no doubt
that Ruskin's help at this critical period was
invaluable, and that without it the young couple
would have suffered even more struggling times
than they did.  For Rossetti was hopelessly
unthrifty, flush of money one day, out-at-elbows
the next, and invariably anticipating any money
to be earned from commissions.  The Ruskin
letters which have been published, throw an
interesting light upon this butterfly existence.
</p>

<p>
Before passing from the subject of Ruskin it
is interesting to note that he enlisted Rossetti as
an active helper in the scheme promoted by
Frederic Denison Maurice for bringing art into
the East end.  His method of teaching has been
described by one who attended his lectures.  He
began at once with colour.  As in his own
personality and his own work, light and shade,
drawing, and everything else was subservient to
colour.  Without troubling about the grammar
of design he gave his pupils nature to copy and
showed them how to copy it.  A later generation
has come to see wisdom in Rossetti's method,
and has introduced it successfully under
government auspices in elementary schools.
</p>

<p>
In 1860 Rossetti and Miss Siddal carried out
their long projected plans of matrimony, which
had been delayed by the latter's illness, by
uncertain prospects, and perhaps also by a final
want of resolution on Rossetti's part.
</p>

<p>
The marriage took place on May 23rd, and
the young couple went for their wedding trip to
Paris and Boulogne.  On their return the rooms
at Chatham Place were extended by opening a
door into the adjoining house.  The independent
bachelor habits to which both were accustomed
made life as Bohemian and irregular after
marriage as before it.  Men friends came and went
as they pleased; tavern dinners relieved the
strain of studio work, and little if any respect
was paid to the conventions of social intercourse.
Mrs. Rossetti's delicate health alone made it
impossible for her to go about much, except
amongst devoted and intimate friends, the chief
of whom in these days perhaps were Algernon
Charles Swinburne and the Madox Brown and
Morris families.  In May, 1861, Mrs. Rossetti
gave birth to a child, still-born, and her slow
recovery, added to the phthisical troubles with
which she was afflicted, induced a severe and
wearing form of neuralgia.  For this she was
prescribed laudanum, of which, on the night of
February 10, 1862, she unhappily took an
overdose.  Poor Rossetti, on returning home from the
Working Men's College, where he had been
lecturing, found his wife already past recovery,
and, frantic with anxiety, rushed off to Highgate
Rise to summon the ever-ready assistance of
Madox Brown.  The following morning she died,
after but two years of married life clouded with
illness; and for a time at least her loss deprived
Rossetti of all capacity for work and almost of
all interest in his art.  The most touching event
in his whole career of swift and flame-like
emotions is the sudden impulse which led him,
as his wife's coffin was being closed, to bury in
her hair the drafts of all his early poems, which
at her request he had copied into a little book.
Only a poet could put into words the dramatic
intensity of grief which was expressed in this now
historic sacrifice to the memory of Rossetti's
dead wife.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
WORK FROM 1854 TO 1857
</h3>

<p>
Rossetti's work, during the earlier part of
the period we have been glancing through,
was of a particularly interesting, and towards
the latter end of a sufficiently varied character.
In range of subject it belongs to the category
described in Chapter III, with the important
addition that now for the first time is added to
his sources of romantic inspiration the "Morte
Darthur" of Sir Thomas Malory.  This cycle of
old Celtic legends had been for many years
practically a sealed book in England, and its
popularity to-day is largely owing to the interest
revived in it by Rossetti, and later by the famous
group of Oxford friends, including William Morris
and Edward Burne-Jones.  Rossetti had become
acquainted with Malory by 1854, which is the
date of that strange, sad little water-colour, <i>King
Arthur's Tomb</i>, representing, in an imaginary
scene, Launcelot bidding a last farewell to
Guenevere.  Apart from this Rossetti had in
hand a number of drawings which were
continually put on one side as fresh ideas crowded
into his restless brain, and were often not
finished until many years later.  The statement
could easily be verified, that many, if not most,
of Rossetti's later pictures were planned during
these early strenuous years of his life, so that it
is not to be wondered at that the actual finished
work of these early years was sparse in quantity
and slight in quality&mdash;much slighter, for instance,
than the two religious paintings with which he
had begun his career.  On the other hand, for
many people these little water-colours of Rossetti's
second period have a charm that nothing in his
larger and more elaborated later work can recall.
</p>

<p>
In the early part of 1854 Rossetti wrote to
Ruskin that he was occupied with ideas for three
subjects, <i>Found</i>, <i>Mary Magdalene at the Door
of Simon</i>, and another which is not named, but
which from the context one may infer to have
been the water-colour diptych of <i>Paolo and
Francesco da Rimini</i>.  In August of the same
year he wrote that he was at work on a <i>Hamlet
and Ophelia</i>, "deeply symbolical of course," and
predestined for the folio which Millais had
presented, and which was still supposed to be in
circulation among the members of a select
sketching club.  About the same time he
submitted to Ruskin two designs for <i>The Passover</i>,
one of which was chosen to be begun at once,
while Ruskin also commissioned seven drawings
from the "Purgatorio," of which one certainly,
<i>Matilda gathering Flowers</i>, was very shortly
put in hand.  None of these undertakings saw
the light for at least another year; the <i>Hamlet</i>
not for four or five.  The <i>Matilda</i> was finished
first and delivered in September 1855, and on
the 2nd December Madox Brown records in his
diary, <i>apropos</i> Miss Siddal being stranded in
Paris without money, "Gabriel, who saw that
none of the drawings on the easel could be
completed before long, began a fresh one,
<i>Francesca da Rimini</i>, in <i>three compartments</i>;
worked day and night, finished it in a week,
got thirty-five guineas for it from Ruskin, and
started off to relieve them."  This was the earliest
version of a subject that Rossetti returned to
more than once, representing in one compartment
the lover's kiss, and in the second their two souls
floating clasped together in Hell through a rain
of pale sulphurous flames.  Between the
compartments are two figures meant for Dante and
Virgil, with the words "O Lasso!"  Within the
same period, viz., by October, 1855, another
Dante subject, <i>The Vision of Rachel and Leah</i>,
was taken up and completed.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Passover</i> drawing, just referred to, is a
small, unfinished water-colour, in which once
more Rossetti has treated the domestic life of
the Holy Family with a reverent freedom from
conventionality, such as Millais used in <i>The
Carpenter's Shop</i> and Holman Hunt in the
<i>Finding of Christ in the Temple</i>.  <i>The Passover</i>
was one of Rossetti's very earliest designs, having
been sketched out first as far back as 1849; it
was the one selected for a memorial window to
Rossetti in the church at Birchington-on-Sea,
where he was buried.
</p>

<p>
Other drawings which are dated, or were
finished by 1855, though they may have been in
hand considerably earlier, are <i>The Nativity</i>, <i>La
Belle Dame sans Mercy</i>, and the <i>Annunciation</i>,
all water-colours.  In the last-named the Virgin
(done from Miss Siddal) is represented washing
clothes in a stream, whilst the angel Gabriel
stands by with folded wings, between two trees:
both are in white, and the picture shows a strong
effect of sunlight.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the foregoing there must be
chronicled under 1855 the first of the important
and beautiful designs for woodcuts, which in the
absence of his pictures were almost the only
means afforded to the public for many years
of judging of Rossetti's work.  This is a drawing
for a poem in William Allingham's "Day and
Night Songs," called <i>The Maids of Elfen-Mere</i>.
Allingham was employed in the Customs in
Ireland, and at the period in question, and for
some years after, Rossetti and he were very
intimate, corresponding freely and vivaciously
on all topics concerning their circle.
</p>

<p>
In 1856 were completed the water-colours of
<i>Dante's Dream</i> and <i>Fra Pace</i>.  Mr. William
Morris, who acquired several early water-colours
by Rossetti, was apparently the first purchaser
of <i>Fra Pace</i>.  The picture represents a kneeling
monk busy illuminating at a desk.  He has
worked so long that the cat has coiled itself up
asleep upon his trailing robe.  A youthful acolyte
is tickling it with a straw in order to beguile the
tedium of the long silence.  The drawing is
somewhat archaic in character and stiff in design,
but it is eminently characteristic of Rossetti, full
of quaint conceits and humour, from the row of
little bottles that hold the good man's pigments
to the dead mouse he is copying and the split
pomegranate that lies uneaten by his side.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Dante's Dream</i> above mentioned is the
first, and in certain points most beautiful, version
of the subject which afterwards served for
Rossetti's largest picture, the one in the Walker
Art Gallery at Liverpool.  The water-colour is
somewhat squarer in shape, but the composition
and pose of the five figures are very much the
same as in the large Liverpool picture.
</p>

<p>
In March, 1856, Rossetti secured an important
commission&mdash;judged by the standard of his
current work and prices&mdash;to paint a reredos in
three compartments for the cathedral of Llandaff,
which John P. Seddon was engaged in restoring.
The subject he chose for this undertaking was
<i>The Seed of David</i>, showing in the centre-piece
the infant Christ on his mother's knee being
adored by a shepherd and a king, and on either
side a single figure of David, first as a shepherd-boy
slinging the stone for Goliath, and secondly
as a king harping to the glory of God.  The
triptych was not completely finished until 1864, and
after that was considerably retouched in 1869,
when Rossetti went down to Llandaff for the
purpose.
</p>

<p>
The year 1856 (or, if we take the date of
publication, 1857) deserves commemoration as the
year of the famous Moxon "Tennyson," for
which Rossetti designed no fewer than five
illustrations.
</p>

<p>
Separate pen-and-ink drawings exist for most,
if not for all, of these Tennyson designs, and
water-colours were afterwards painted from three
of them.
</p>

<p>
In point of number and interest the productions
of 1857 are remarkable.  It was the year of
the Oxford frescoes, for one thing, though these
dragged on till 1859; and it was the year of a
charming little series of water-colours, which
were acquired one after the other by Rossetti's
newly-made acquaintance, William Morris, who,
some time later, being in want of capital for
his own business, sold them in a batch to their
late possessor, Mr. George Rae.  These comprise:
</p>

<p>
(1) The <i>Damsel of the Sanc Grael</i>, robed in
green, holding a long-stemmed cup in her hand.
</p>

<p>
(2) <i>The Death of Breuse sans Pitié</i>, one of the
crudest and least successful of Rossetti's
water-colours.
</p>

<p>
(3) <i>The Chapel before the Lists</i>, a scene
suggested by Malory of a lady helping to arm a
kneeling knight, her long white head-dress, as
she stoops to kiss him, falling like a mantle
down her blue dress.  Upon the pointed shield
of the knight is a figure of a maiden in distress.
Beyond the chapel is a tented field, and knights
going forth to joust.
</p>

<p>
(4) <i>The Tune of Seven Towers</i>, a quaint little
scene, very characteristic of Rossetti's fertility
and originality of invention.  A lady in red with
mediaeval head-dress is sitting in a high oaken
chair, which above towers up into a sort of
belfry, and is playing upon a musical instrument
which also forms part of the chair.  A man in
green doublet, with long boots, sits sideways on
a stool close by watching her, and a second lady
stands mournfully behind.  A banner hangs down
at the right from a pole which cuts the picture
diagonally in half.
</p>

<p>
(5) <i>The Blue Closet</i>, illustrated and described
elsewhere.

<br>
THE BLUE CLOSET.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Wedding of St. George</i>, in the same collection,
belongs to this year, but was not acquired
from Mr. Morris.  The old story of St. George
and the Dragon had a powerful influence upon
the romantic school to which Rossetti belonged.
Burne-Jones's variations upon it are well known,
and Rossetti also, besides treating it as a whole
in a series of designs for stained glass windows,
painted St. George more than once at typical
stages of the adventure.  In this earliest version
he is resting from his feat, clad in armour, with
a gorgeous surcoat, whilst the princess kneels
and leans her head upon his breast, cutting off
a long dark lock of hair which she has bound
upon the crest of his helmet.  The dragon's head,
a monstrous object, stands grotesquely in one
corner in a box with ropes attached for drawing
it along.  In the background is a hedge of
flowers and attendant angels playing on bells.
</p>

<p>
The artistic and romantic impulses stirring in
England at the midpoint of the century had, as
we have seen, produced one notable movement
in the shape of the "Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood."  Five or six years later they gave rise to
another, not less important, and shortly afterwards
a fusion of the two took place.  The second
of these "Brotherhoods"&mdash;the word was actually
adopted for a time&mdash;had its origin at Exeter
College, Oxford, in the personalities of William
Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, and resolved
itself at first, like its forerunner, into a "crusade
and holy warfare against the age," with an added
religious tinge which was hardly visible in the
other.  The Oxford group, like the "P.R.B.,"
published a magazine to illustrate, not to preach,
their principles, and had as a tangible link with
Rossetti the same warm appreciation of the
beauties of the Arthurian legend first introduced
to their notice by Burne-Jones.
</p>

<p>
In the Christmas vacation of 1855 Burne-Jones
came up to London, and after attending
a meeting of the Working Men's College in order
to see Rossetti, whom he and Morris had already
begun to worship, he was introduced to him at
Vernon Lushington's rooms in Doctors' Commons.
The next day he visited Rossetti in his
studio at Blackfriars, and saw him working on <i>Fra
Pace</i>.  Thus was laid the foundation of an alliance
which even more potently than the "P.R.B." has
changed the face of art in England, and which
resulted in the formation of a group that for
combined poetic, literary, and artistic power is
unapproached in the history of the nation.
Incidentally, it was this visit that determined
Burne-Jones&mdash;hankering after art, but predestined for
the Church&mdash;to become a painter; and no one
can fail to be struck with the evidence of
Rossetti's influence upon his early work.
</p>

<p>
To the "Oxford and Cambridge Magazine,"
William Morris's organ, which ran for the twelve
months of 1856, Rossetti contributed "The
Burden of Nineveh," "The Blessed Damozel"
(a little altered from the "Germ" version), and
"The Staff and Scrip."
</p>

<p>
By the end of 1856 Burne-Jones and Morris
had left Oxford and were settled in London,
occupying the rooms at 17, Red Lion Square,
which had formerly served as a studio for Rossetti
and Deverell.  Both were under the spell of
Rossetti's influence.  The <i>ménage</i> at Red Lion
Square lasted till 1859, and was a rallying point
for all members of the circle.  "From the incidents
that occurred or were invented there," says
Mr. Mackail, "a sort of Book of the Hundred
Merry Tales gradually was formed, of which
Morris was the central figure."  The rooms were
"the quaintest in all London," as Burne-Jones
wrote, "hung with brasses of old knights and
drawings of Albert Dürer"; and in order to
furnish them recourse had to be had to invention.
A local joiner was engaged to manufacture
furniture from Morris's own designs: "intensely
mediaeval" was Rossetti's description of it to a
friend, "tables and chairs like incubi and
succubi."  Next came the idea of painting pictures
on walls, cupboards, and doors, about the time
that Morris was planning to build himself at
Upton, in the neighbourhood of Bexley Heath,
a "palace of art" the like of which should never
have been seen.  In the general enthusiasm
Rossetti set to and designed a pair of panels for
a cabinet&mdash;the subject of his early pen-and-ink
drawing, <i>The Salutation of Beatrice</i>, representing
in two compartments Dante meeting Beatrice in
Florence, and again in Paradise.
</p>

<p>
At the risk of repetition, one may mention
once more a side of the movement which is apt
to be overshadowed by its far-reaching results;
namely, the light-heartedness and sense of fun
which prevailed amongst this band of artistic
pioneers.  There was nothing of the mawkish
affectation which discredited the aesthetes who
came after.  When Burne-Jones was down at
Upton, helping to decorate the Red House in
1860, Rossetti wrote to a mutual friend: "I wish
you were in town, to see you sometimes, for I
literally see no one now except Madox Brown
pretty often, and even he is gone to join Morris,
who is out of reach at Upton, and with them is
married Jones painting the inner walls of the
house that Top built (Morris was always called
'Topsy' by his friends).  But as for the
neighbours, when they see men pourtrayed by Jones
upon the walls, the images of the Chaldeans
pourtrayed (by <i>him!</i>) in Extract Vermilion, exceeding
all probability in dyed attire upon their heads,
after the manner of no Babylonians of any
Chaldea, the land of anyone's nativity&mdash;as soon as
they see them with their eyes, shall they not
account him doting and send messengers into
Colney Hatch?"
</p>

<p>
During the long vacation of 1857 Rossetti
went up to Oxford with Morris on a visit to the
architect, Benjamin Woodward, who was at work
upon a debating hall for the Union Society, and
seeing an opportunity for mural decoration of a
kind never previously attempted in England in
the new hall of the Union, he became fired with
an idea for carrying it out.  The hall was a long
building, with an apse at each end, and a gallery
running all the way round.  In this gallery were
bookcases, and above the cases were ten semi-circular
bays, each pierced with a pair of circular
windows.  These bays, it was suggested, should
be painted with scenes from the Arthurian legend,
and the roof, as part of the general scheme, was
to be decorated in a harmonious manner.  A
building committee was in charge of the operations,
and without any clear idea of its responsibilities
or restrictions it fell in with Rossetti's
proposal that he and a select band of artists should
execute the work gratuitously, but that the Union
should defray their expenses at Oxford and should
provide all necessary materials.  The time
estimated for completing the work was six weeks.
Seven artists, including Rossetti, Burne-Jones,
and Morris, were enlisted without much trouble,
the remaining four being Arthur Hughes, Spencer
Stanhope, Val Prinsep, and J. Hungerford Pollen,
who had already won much credit from his
painting of the roof in Merton College Chapel.
Rossetti took as subjects for two bays <i>Launcelot
asleep before the Chapel of the Sanc Grael</i> and
<i>Sir Galahad, Sir Bors and Sir Percival receiving
the Sanc Grael</i>.  The others chose similar themes,
but in a short time it was found that the work
in hand was considerably more than had been
anticipated, though abundant evidence remains
of the enthusiasm which was put into it.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately the delight was not to be of
long duration.  Almost before the pictures were
finished they had begun to decay, the effect of
tempera laid direct upon a new brick wall, with
no preparation but a layer of whitewash, being
quite inadequate to resist the English climate.
Several of the designs were never completed.
In 1859 some arrangement was entered into by
the Union with a Mr. Riviere to fill the three
blank compartments; and after that the ill-fated
undertaking, on which so much pains and so
much skill had been spent, gradually faded away
and resolved itself into what it is to-day, a dingy
blur of colours in which may be distinguished
the occasional vague form of an armoured limb
or a patch of flowery background.
</p>

<p>
Rossetti's connection with Oxford, and its
intercalation in his work, does not end with the
Union paintings.  It was destined to furnish him
with a more lasting influence&mdash;a face that to the
end of his life haunted his pictures with an austere
and solemn beauty, dominating and transforming
all other kinds, so as even to give rise to the
suggestion&mdash;a shallow and ignorant one, it is
true&mdash;that he painted but one type of face.  It
was at the theatre, one night in the summer
of 1857, that Rossetti and Burne-Jones found
themselves sitting near two youthful Misses
Burden, daughters of an Oxford resident, the
elder of whom, by her striking features and
wealth of dark wavy hair, appealed so forcibly
to Rossetti's painter eye that he obtained an
introduction in order to ask for sittings.  A
pen-and-ink head called <i>Queen Guenevere</i>, now in
the National Gallery at Dublin, and evidently
intended to replace the earlier studies done for
<i>Launcelot at the Shrine</i>, was one of the first
fruits of this acquaintance, which, for the rest,
does not seem to have become really prolific of
results until several years later, when Rossetti's
wife was dead.  In the meantime William Morris,
whose admiration went even further, had married
Miss Burden, and the casual relationship of
painter and sitter which existed between her
and Rossetti deepened into a friendship, in which
Miss Siddal participated, both up to and after
her marriage.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
WORK FROM 1858 TO 1862
</h3>

<p>
The year 1858, while the Oxford affair
was still in train, saw the completion of
two pen-and-ink drawings which had been in hand
a long time.  These were <i>Hamlet and Ophelia</i>
and <i>Mary Magdalene at the Door of Simon the
Pharisee</i>.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>

<br>
MARY MAGDALENE AT THE HOUSE OF SIMON THE PHARISEE.
</p>

<p>
The drawing of <i>Mary Magdalene</i>, perhaps
the most perfect of all Rossetti's early works,
was begun at least by 1853, and continued to
occupy his thoughts in one form or another
for many years.  Rossetti wrote a sonnet for the
picture, which is found in his first volume,
called "Poems."
</p>

<p>
Another subject finished in 1858 was <i>Mary
in the House of John</i>.  The scene is at late
twilight, or in an eastern night, the red glow of
the sky casting a purple light over the clustered
dwellings of Nazareth, with deep blue hills
beyond.  In the interior of the room are Mary
and St. John, the latter seated in shadow, engaged
in striking light from a flint; whilst Mary, standing
before the tall window, fills a hanging lamp
from a jar of oil.
</p>

<p>
Another important item to be recorded under
1858 is a water-colour called <i>Before the Battle</i>,
painted for Rossetti's American friend, Professor
Norton, of Harvard.
</p>

<p>
The most important work of 1859 is a highly-finished
little head in oils, called <i>Bocca Baciata</i>,
which was bought by the late Mr. Boyce.  The
model for this was Miss Fanny Cornforth,
afterwards Mrs. Schott, whose florid type of beauty
reappears in a series of sensuous pictures of the
kind that Rossetti began to paint after 1862&mdash;<i>Aurelia</i>
(<i>Fazio's Mistress</i>), <i>The Blue Bower</i>, <i>The
Lady at her Toilet</i>, <i>Lilith</i>, and<i> The Lady of the
Fan</i>.  These pictures, and numerous portraits in
oil and water-colour, give a sufficiently recognizable
idea of this model, who exercised almost as
remarkable an influence over Rossetti's life as
over his art.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bonifazio's Mistress</i>, a specially charming little
water-colour, was painted in 1860.  It shows a
lady (dressed in the same brightly be-ribanded
flounces as Lucretia Borgia wears in the little
1851 group) who has been sitting to her lover,
a painter, when suddenly she has fallen back in
her chair, dead.
</p>

<p>
The connection of this subject with the poet,
Bonifazio (or Fazio) degli Uberti is entirely
fanciful.  There can be little doubt that it was
intended to illustrate Rossetti's own story of
"St. Agnes of Intercession."  <i>Bonifazio's Mistress</i>
has no connection whatever either in subject or
composition with the oil painting of the same
name done in 1863, and afterwards re-named
<i>Aurelia</i>.  The latter is simply a three-quarter
length figure of a lady plaiting her hair before a
toilet glass.
</p>

<p>
This (1860) was the year of Rossetti's marriage,
as has already been stated, and in June he was
at Paris on his honeymoon.  While there he
executed two pen-and-ink drawings, one of which
was the design of <i>How they met Themselves</i>,
done to replace the earlier version of 1851, which
had been lost.  The other represents a scene
from Boswell's "Life of Johnson," a curious
source of inspiration for Rossetti, rendered more
remarkable from the fact that the incident chosen
is of a humorous and spicy character.  Dr. Maxwell
told the story how two young women
from Staffordshire had come up to town to
consult Johnson about Methodism, in which they
were much interested.  "Come," said he, "you
pretty fools, dine with Maxwell and me at the
Mitre, and we will talk over that subject";
which they did, and after dinner he took one of
them on his knee, and fondled her for half-an-hour
together.
</p>

<p>
In 1861 Rossetti's translations from the Italian
poets were at last published, together with the
"Vita Nuova."  Rossetti thought out a very
charming design of two lovers kissing in a
rose-garden, which he proposed to etch on copper for
the title-page.  The plate, however, displeased
him, and he destroyed it.  The central idea of
this design reappears in <i>Love's Greeting</i>, a panel
designed for the Red House, and in a water-colour
of 1864 inscribed <i>Roman de la Rose</i>, in
which Love appears overshadowing the kissing
pair with his wings.
</p>

<p>
In 1861 was painted, on a little panel, 10 by
8 inches, a portrait of Mrs. Rossetti, called <i>Regina
Cordium</i> or <i>The Queen of Hearts</i>, showing just
the head and bare shoulders, on a gold ground,
behind a parapet on which rests one hand holding
a purple pansy.  A more important outcome of
the year is the fine composition known as
<i>Cassandra</i>.  The subject is a scene on the walls
of Troy just before Hector's last battle.  Rossetti
wrote two sonnets for the drawing which will be
found in his volume of "Poems."
</p>

<p>
About this time (1861-1862) the firm of
Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co. was just
being started, with William Morris, Rossetti,
Faulkner, Burne-Jones, Madox Brown, Webb,
and others as the active promoters of a venture
which was to reform the arts of decoration and
furniture making.  Tapestry, furniture, wallpapers,
stained glass, painted panels, and later
on carpet-weaving and dyeing, were among the
industries to which this band of highly original
artists and designers turned their attention.  The
Anglo-Catholic movement and the demand for
decoration of an aesthetic and sensuous kind
gave the new firm plenty to do, amongst their
first commissions being the embellishment of
two new churches then being built by Bodley,
St. Martin's on the Hill, Scarborough, and
St. Michael's at Brighton.  For the former Rossetti
executed a design for two pulpit panels and
several windows, achieving from the very first
a mastery over this branch of art which few
designers have surpassed.  It is characteristic of
his original mind that he went right back to the
fundamental principles of <i>vitraux</i>, paying no
attention whatever to the elaborations which
had grown round them, and recognizing that a
picture which was transparent, that is, seen by
transmitted light, must be conceived in flat tones
and not made to give the illusion of shading, as
can be done in the case of a surface from which
the light is reflected.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Paolo and Francesca</i> water-colour is
generally attributed to the year 1861, although
no particular authority exists for this beyond an
auctioneer's catalogue.  This beautiful little
water-colour represents the first compartment
of the double subject.  In it Paolo and Francesca
are seated before a window bearing the arms of
Malatesta.  Outside is a bright and sunny
landscape.  The lovers have stopped in the midst of
their reading to give the fatal kiss that sealed
their doom.
</p>

<p>
In 1861 or 1862 Rossetti designed two woodcuts
for his sister Christina's "Goblin Market,"
published by Messrs. Macmillan.  In 1865 he
drew two more designs for "The Prince's
Progress."  The covers for these two little volumes,
as well as for his own when they appeared, were
designed by Rossetti, and are as original and
effective and tasteful as his decorative work
invariably was.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
SETTLING AT CHELSEA.  WORK, 1863 TO 1874
</h3>

<p>
After the tragic death of his wife, on
February 11th, 1862, Rossetti could no
longer bear to occupy the rooms they had
inhabited at Chatham Place, and began to seek for
others.  In the meantime he took lodgings for a
few months in a house in Lincoln's Inn Fields.
He had a fancy for getting away from the crowd
of London, and yet for being near the river,
which caused him to examine one or two old
houses in the then by no means fashionable
neighbourhoods of Hammersmith and Chelsea.
He finally decided in favour of No. 16, Cheyne
Walk, a house which from some traditional
association with Queen Elizabeth became known
as Tudor House and is now called Queen's
House.  It is also said to have been described
by Thackeray in "Esmond" as the home of the
old Countess of Chelsey.  Here he started a joint
<i>ménage</i> with Mr. Swinburne, Mr. George Meredith,
and (at casual intervals) his brother.
Mr. Meredith's subtenancy was not of long duration;
in point of fact he never really occupied
his rooms.  But Mr. Swinburne remained long
enough to have shared very considerably the
traditions which soon grew up round Tudor House,
and whilst there wrote the most famous of his
dramas, "Atalanta in Calydon," as well as many
of the "Poems and Ballads," and a portion of
"Chastelard."  The gloom which at first had
threatened Rossetti gradually wore away before
the robustness of his nature; settling into and
furnishing his house on new, and at that time
practically unheard-of, principles, afforded
abundant distraction; and for some years, until his
own illness intervened, Rossetti played the genial
and charming host to many old friends of his
intimate group, and to an increasing circle of new
ones who were attracted by sympathy or by
the growing glamour of his name.
</p>

<p>
One of the charms of the house at Chelsea
was its long garden, more than an acre in extent,
with an avenue of trees on to which the studio
looked.  As time went on this garden became
tenanted with a miscellaneous assortment of birds
and animals, round which a veritable saga of
anecdote has gathered.  These, with his affection
for bric-à-brac, his spontaneous generosity, his
ever-ready wit, his love of good stories, and his
endless flow of <i>vers d'esprit</i>, form a contrast to
the somewhat sombre atmosphere in which he
sought his inspirations, and in which, owing to
the seclusion of his later years, he was popularly
supposed to live.
</p>

<p>
To resume the thread of Rossetti's work, the
well-known picture of <i>Beata Beatrix</i>, now in the
National Collection, bears date 1863, but was
only partially painted in that year, the completion
being long delayed.  One reason for the difficulty
may have been that Rossetti desired to make
this picture a living memorial of his wife, and
that no regular studies of the face had been done
for it.  What he felt about it we may gather from
the fact that for some years he refused to send
out a replica, even when replicas had become a
regular and lucrative form of business.  In the
end, however, he was prevailed upon to paint
more than one repetition of the subject, none
however equal in quality to the original.
</p>

<p>
To 1863 belongs a small oil picture called
<i>Helen of Troy</i>, a full-faced study, head and
shoulders only, of a rather pretty model, with
masses of rippling yellow hair.  The last of the
<i>St. George</i> subjects also belongs to this year, and
represents St. George in the act of slaying the
dragon; a water-colour version of one of the
incidents in a series designed for windows, but
treated a little differently.  Next come three small
subjects: <i>Belcolore</i>, a very finely painted head of
a girl biting a rosebud; <i>Brimfull</i>, a water-colour
sketch of a lady stooping to sip from a glass;
and thirdly, a picture called <i>A Lady in Yellow</i>,
belonging to Mr. Beresford Heaton.  We are
now entering upon the period when Rossetti
ceased to paint small heads and began to devote
himself to larger single figure subjects, lavishing
upon them the wealth of his fine imagination,
and surrounding them with quaint and beautiful
accessories such as he alone knew how to select.
The first picture of this type, and in point of
execution one of the very finest, is <i>Fazio's
Mistress</i>, a small oil painting dated 1863, but
considerably altered ten years later, when Rossetti
renamed it <i>Aurelia</i>.
</p>

<p>
The year 1864 contains two or three more
prominent examples of Rossetti's attraction
towards a luxuriant and seductive type of feminine
beauty.  The most important is <i>Lady Lilith</i>,
which embodies perhaps the fullest expression
of Rossetti's power in this direction.  Adam's
mythical first wife is shown as a beautiful woman
leaning back on a couch combing her long fair
hair, while with cold dispassionateness she
surveys her features in a hand mirror.  "Body's
Beauty" Rossetti called the picture afterwards,
contrasting it with his conception of "Soul's
Beauty," the <i>Sibylla Palmifera</i> of 1866-70.
</p>

<p>
Still in the same vein&mdash;of "Women and
Flowers"&mdash;is the next great picture begun in
1864, the <i>Venus Verticordia</i>.  The principal version
of this, an oil painting, was not finished until
some time in 1868.  The earliest in point of date
is a little water-colour commissioned as a replica,
which was delivered during the year.  The picture
represents the goddess of beauty undraped and
standing in a bower of clustering honeysuckle
which hides her to the waist.  In her left hand
she holds an apple, in her right a dart upon
which is poised a sulphur butterfly.  Others are
hovering round.  Behind is the grove of Venus,
and a blue bird winging its way through space.
</p>

<p>
The remaining productions of 1864 are all in
water-colour.  They include <i>Morning Music</i>,
<i>Monna Pomona</i>, <i>Sir Galahad</i>, <i>Sir Bors</i>, and <i>Sir
Percival</i>&mdash;belonging to Rossetti's earlier manner;
<i>Roman de la Rose</i>, and <i>The Madness of Ophelia</i>,
a scene representing Laertes leading Ophelia
away, whilst the king and queen are looking on.
</p>

<p>
In 1865 was painted the <i>Blue Bower</i>, a picture
of the <i>Lilith</i> group, done from the <i>Lilith</i> model,
and representing in a setting of gorgeous blue
and green harmonies a woman playing upon a
dulcimer.  <i>The Merciless Lady</i>, which was painted
in 1865, is a return to Rossetti's early romantic
compositions, and is a particularly charming
specimen.  Nor was it his only water-colour of
this year, though indisputably the best.  For
Mr. Craven he painted the subject called <i>Washing
Hands</i>&mdash;with the exception of <i>Dr. Johnson at the
Mitre</i>, his one experiment in (eighteenth century
costume.
</p>

<p>
Another called <i>A Fight for a Woman</i>, is one
of Rossetti's most spirited drawings.  In point of
invention this design goes back to very early
days, as is proved by the existence of tentative
sketches dating from about 1853.  To the same
date belongs the oil painting called originally
<i>Bella e Buona</i>, but renamed by Rossetti <i>Il
Ramoscello</i> in 1873, when it was taken back by
him for retouching.  It is a half-length figure,
dressed in slate green, and holding an acorn
branch.
</p>

<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-078.jpg" alt="THE BELOVED.">
<br>
THE BELOVED.
</p>

<p>
We now come to one of the most beautiful
pictures, if not the most beautiful, that Rossetti
ever painted&mdash;<i>The Beloved</i>.  No one who has
not seen it, with a warm sunlight bringing out
its colour, can form the most remote conception
of its brilliance.  "I mean it to be like jewels,"
wrote Rossetti to its late owner, Mr. Rae; and
jewel-like it flashes.  The picture itself is
described in a later chapter, amongst those selected
for illustration.
</p>

<p>
In 1866, the year in which the <i>Beloved</i> was
finished, Rossetti started upon a second great
picture of the same type, the <i>Monna Vanna</i>, a
three-quarter length figure draped in magnificent
gold and white brocade, and toying with a large
fan.  This was commissioned by Mr. Rae, as was
also <i>Sibylla Palmifera</i>, the third of the series,
begun about the same time but not completed
until 1870.  Rossetti's sonnet entitled "Soul's
Beauty" describes the subject&mdash;a Sibyl seated
on a throne and bearing a branch of palm.
</p>

<p>
The record of 1866 closes with an oil portrait
of the painter's mother, towards whom at all
periods of his life his devotion was exemplary; a
large crayon drawing of Christina Rossetti, with
her thoughtful face resting on her hands; and
two designs for her second volume of poems,
"The Prince's Progress."
</p>

<p>
In 1867 Rossetti painted the oil <i>Christmas
Carol</i> for Mr. Rae, an entirely different subject
from the early water-colour.  This is a half-length
figure of a girl, draped in a gold and purple robe
of Eastern stuff, and playing upon a species of
lute.  Two small but pretty pictures of the same
date are <i>Joli Cœur</i> and <i>Monna Rosa</i>.  The first
represents a coy-looking maiden fingering her
necklace, whilst <i>Monna Rosa</i> is chiefly a study in
beautiful colour, representing a lady in a dress
of pale emerald green, with golden fruit worked
upon it, plucking a rose from a tree planted in
a blue jar.
</p>

<p>
The next item of 1867 is the exquisite <i>Loving
Cup</i>.  The subject is a lady raising a golden cup
to her lips, and standing against a background
of fair embroidered linen, surmounted by a row
of heavy brazen plates.
</p>

<p>
The year 1868 was cut into by Rossetti's
breakdown in health and sudden anxiety about
his eyesight.  Nevertheless, he painted the portrait
of Mrs. William Morris, in a blue dress, seated
at a table before a glass of flowers, which many
competent judges regard as one of his very finest
pictures, and which was the prelude to that long
series of noble canvases by which he has become
best known to the public.  Mrs. Morris has lent
her portrait to the National Gallery, where it
hangs (at Millbank) beside the <i>Ecce Ancilla</i> and
the <i>Beata Beatrix</i>.  Other productions of the
same year, which closes the period of Rossetti's
best work, were <i>Bionda del Balcone</i>; <i>Aurea
Catena</i>, a fine drawing of Mrs. Morris; two
studies for a future picture, <i>La Pia</i>, and some
small replicas of no particular importance.
</p>

<p>
The insomnia which began to attack Rossetti
in his thirty-ninth year, and which was the
indirect cause of his subsequent breakdown, led
him in 1869 to drop work for a time and to take
a holiday at Penkill Castle in Ayrshire, the
residence of an old friend.  The visit is of
interest, because it was not until this occasion
that he gave a serious thought to the publishing
of his early poems, some of which were still
going about in manuscript in a more or less
finished condition, though others were buried in
his wife's grave.  As a relief from the strain of
painting, moreover, he began to write again.
His first idea was to have the poems, such of
them as he could collect or recall from memory,
set up in type to keep by him as a nucleus for a
possible volume; gradually, however, the idea
of publishing outright grew or was forced upon
him; and the last obstacle to this, the loss of so
much of his early work, was finally removed one
day in October, 1869, when, after a consent
wrung from him very reluctantly, the grave was
opened, and the manuscript poems recovered.
In 1870 the book appeared, having as publisher
Mr. F  S. Ellis, of King Street, Covent Garden.
The poems proved an immediate and lucrative
success, and were favourably reviewed except
for the single attack made upon them in a
pseudonymous article by the late Mr. Buchanan.
The effect of even one attack, however, and it
was admittedly a very unfair and bitter attack,
on a man of Rossetti's temperament, suffering
from nervous fancies, and troubled by want of
sleep, was disastrous.  He viewed as a great
conspiracy against him what other men, in
sounder health, would have been able to
disregard, and the effect was unhappily permanent.
He had begun to acquire the habit of taking
chloral as a cure for sleeplessness, without
knowing, what is well known now, its lamentable
after-effect, and for a short time, if one may
accept his brother's judgment, Rossetti was
hardly to be regarded as sane.  A severe
breakdown caused him to be removed once more to
Scotland, where after a complete rest he was
enabled to resume painting, and in September,
1872, he joined with Mr. and Mrs. Morris in
taking the old Elizabethan Manor House of
Kelmscott, on the borders of Oxfordshire and
Gloucestershire.  His work here consisted to a
large extent in repainting many of his old pictures,
which he had sent to him for the purpose.  In
this way he worked upon the <i>Lilith</i>, <i>Beloved</i>,
<i>Monna Vanna</i>, and other important canvases,
including even the little early <i>Ecce Ancilla
Domini</i>.  Rossetti left Kelmscott in July, 1874,
and returned to London; and that was the end
of his connection with the quiet Gloucestershire
retreat, which thenceforward became associated
solely with the life of William Morris.
</p>

<p>
During the years 1869 to 1871, and the two
following which Rossetti spent at Kelmscott, he
was at work on a number of fairly important
new canvases in addition to the retouching of
old ones.  A sprinkling of crayons and small
pictures also has to be mentioned.  These include
the <i>Rosa Triplex</i>, a study of three heads from
one sitter, now in the Tate Gallery, and <i>Penelope</i>,
a crayon drawing of a seated figure, which is
unique in the respect that it was done from a
favourite model of Sir Edward Burne-Jones.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the year 1870, with one or two
exceptions, Mrs. Morris's is the face which figures
in Rossetti's work.  It is to be seen, for instance,
in the fine picture called <i>Mariana</i>, really a first
attempt at the portrait in the Tate Gallery lent
by Mrs. Morris, to which a second figure was
subsequently added.
</p>

<p>
In 1871 he painted the picture of <i>Pandora</i>,
of which Mr. Swinburne says, in his "Essays and
Studies," that "it is amongst the mightiest of
all Rossetti's works in its God-like terror and
imperial trouble of beauty."  The figure is clad
in a long robe of Venetian red, and is holding
the fateful casket, from which issues a red smoke,
curling all round into clustering shapes, like
flame-winged seraph curses.  <i>Water-willow</i>, a
little quarter-length figure with a river landscape
behind, done in the same year, is interesting
from the fact that it is a portrait of Mrs. Morris,
and that the view represents Kelmscott.
</p>

<p>
We now come to the picture of <i>Dante's Dream</i>,
begun in 1870 and finished towards the close
of 1871, Rossetti's most important work in the
opinion of many people, and considerably his
largest.  The subject is that of the little early
water-colour painted in 1856, namely the vision
related by Dante as having come to him of
Beatrice lying in death, and the angels bearing
upward her soul in the form of "an exceedingly
white cloud."  The picture is more fully described
elsewhere.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-084"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-084.jpg" alt="MARIANA.">
<br>
MARIANA.
</p>

<p>
Impressive as <i>Dante's Dream</i> may be, it is
not to be classed on all grounds with Rossetti's
finest work.  Yet it has been the object of
boundless admiration.  It has even been said
that if no other of Rossetti's works survived but
this and the <i>Beata Beatrix</i>, they alone would be
enough to ensure him a place among the few
great artists of the world.
</p>

<p>
The next great subject in point of date, namely
<i>Proserpine</i>, has a complicated history attached
to it.  Rossetti began the picture upon canvas
four times in 1872, with ill-success.  He took it
up again in 1873 and painted a fine version
which was spoilt in straining.  This was replaced
in the same year by a second fine one which
arrived at its destination damaged by an accident
in transit.  A third large picture had therefore to
be painted in 1874, which still exists, and finally
the damaged picture was patched and partially
repainted in 1877, which is the date it bears in
the corner.  This is the finest and best known
version, and is the one of which an autotype
reproduction has been published.  There are
sundry other replicas and crayon studies of the
subject which have not been mentioned, but of
the earlier attempts nothing now seems to be
left in the form of pictures, the canvases having
been cut down into the form of single heads.  In
all these pictures the subject is the same.  The
ravished bride of Pluto is seen standing in a
corridor of Hades, lighted by a bluish
subterranean light, and holding in one hand the
pomegranate of which she ate one fatal seed
that bound her for ever to her destiny.  In none
of the pictures done from Mrs. Morris do we
find so appropriate the distant air of melancholy
with which the painter contrived to invest her
features.
</p>

<p>
Of the other pictures painted at Kelmscott
perhaps the most successful is <i>Veronica Veronese</i>,
supposed to be taken from a passage in the
letters of Girolamo Ridolfi, which describes how
a lady, after listening to the notes of a bird, tries
to commit them to paper, and finally to reproduce
them on her violin.  In the picture the Lady
Veronica is robed in a rich gown of Rossetti's
favourite green, with yellow daffodils in a glass
beside her.  The bird, a canary, is perched on a
cage above her.  She sits at a cabinet, on which
is a sheet with the musical notes she has been
writing down; and listening with dreamy blue
eyes to the bird's song she lets her thumb wander
over the strings of the violin suspended on the
wall before her.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving the year 1872 there is a minor
but interesting episode to record.  In this year
Rossetti took up an old background of trees and
foliage which he had painted in 1850, in his
Pre-Raphaelite days, when studying with Holman
Hunt at Knole Park, near Sevenoaks.  Nothing
had ever been done to it since; but now
Rossetti painted in two women playing instruments
and a group of dancing figures, for which very
charming crayon studies were made, and called
it <i>The Bower Meadow</i>.  This interesting
combination of early and late styles now belongs to
Sir J. D. Milburn, of Newcastle.
</p>

<p>
<i>La Ghirlandata</i>, the next great oil picture by
Rossetti, is dated 1873, and is one of those
which has already crossed the Atlantic to the
bourne whence works of art but seldom return.
The picture represents a lady playing upon a
garlanded harp, in the midst of a forest clearing,
where angel faces peer down upon her, and
mystical blue birds cleave the air.  The whole
is a subtle blending of subdued colour, where
blue and green strive for the mastery.  Beautiful
as it is in these respects, <i>La Ghirlandata</i> lacks
the invention and the interest of Rossetti's more
vigorous early work.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Damsel of the Sanc Grael</i>, painted in
1874 for Mr. Rae, is a very different picture
from the little water-colour of 1856-7.  There
was a simplicity and primitiveness about the
latter which accorded well with the mediaeval
sanctity surrounding the subject.  When Rossetti
came to paint the picture again in his later
manner, he represented the austere damsel of
the holy mysteries as a handsome girl with
flowing chestnut hair, bright lips, and languishing
eyes, sumptuously robed in a red gown with
a heavily-flowered mantle.  In painting this
picture Rossetti probably did not seek much
beyond mere beauty of form and decoration, in
the attainment of which he has succeeded
perfectly; and the same may be said in part of a
better-known production of the same year, the
much-praised <i>Roman Widow</i>, which represents
a lady seated by the marble tomb of her husband.
A large unfinished canvas, painted simply in
grisaille, called <i>The Boat of Love</i>, was begun at
this time but abandoned in 1881.  After Rossetti's
death it was bought for the Birmingham
Corporation Art Gallery, where it is now exhibited.
It may be mentioned that the Birmingham
Gallery possesses an unequalled collection of
Rossetti's drawings, recently acquired (1906) through
the munificence of two or three local donors.
</p>

<p>
One other subject dated 1874 is intimately
bound up with Kelmscott.  This is an oil picture
called by a variety of names&mdash;<i>Marigolds</i>, <i>Fleurs
de Marie</i>, <i>The Gardener's Daughter</i>, etc., but
representing in actual fact a young girl standing
in a room, and reaching up to place a mass of
yellow marigolds and lilies in a flower vase upon
a high cabinet of inlaid wood.  The model is
said to have been the gardener's daughter at
Kelmscott, not that the detail signifies, except
as connecting the picture with the place.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
CLOSE OF THE RECORD. 1874-1882
</h3>

<p>
One of the first incidents to be recorded
after Rossetti's return to London in 1874
was the dissolution of the partnership of Morris,
Marshall, Faulkner and Co., and the re-construction
of the firm under the sole management of
William Morris.  The dissolution was not effected
without some unpleasantness, resulting in the
estrangement of Morris and Brown.  Morris and
Rossetti never actually quarrelled; but from
1874 onwards the two men seldom saw each
other, Rossetti's recluse habits of life being
possibly responsible to some extent for the
severance.
</p>

<p>
The latter part of 1875 and the first half of
1876 Rossetti spent at Bognor, and after that
he visited the Cowper-Temples (afterwards Lord
and Lady Mount Temple) at Broadlands in
Hampshire, being then engaged upon his picture
of <i>The Blessed Damozel</i>.
</p>

<p>
In 1877 he had a very severe physical illness,
due to an uraemic affection which had been set
up in 1872, and which eventually was the active
cause of his death.  He was removed to a little
cottage near Herne Bay, and at one time gave
up all hope of resuming his profession.  "At
last," says Mr. William Rossetti, "the power and
the determination returned simultaneously; he
drew an admirable crayon-group of our mother
and sister, two others equally good of the latter,
and yet another of our mother.  Weather had
been favourable, spirits and energy revived, and
he came back to town nerved once more for the
battle of life and of art."  The group of Mrs. and
Miss Rossetti is now in the National Portrait
Gallery.
</p>

<p>
After 1877 Rossetti seldom if ever went beyond
the doors of No. 16, Cheyne Walk, and as he
suffered from fits of melancholy, and disliked
being alone, a few faithful friends formed the
practice of coming to visit him by turns.
Mr. Theodore Watts was a more constant attendant,
and had a bed at his disposal.  A good number
of acquaintances also frequented the house, some
of them much more intimate than others and
dating back in their relations to about 1866.
Among these may be mentioned the artists
J. M. Whistler and Alphonse Legros, Frederick
Shields, F. A. Sandys and Fairfax Murray.
</p>

<p>
In 1878, or thereabouts, Rossetti's devotion
to poetry received a fresh impulse, and he set
himself assiduously to the production of sonnets.
It was not until 1880, however, that he began
really to compile materials for a new volume.
In that year he wrote "The White Ship," and
in the year following "The King's Tragedy."  Finally,
by March of 1881 the copy for "Ballads
and Sonnets" was complete, and was accepted
by Messrs. Ellis and White on the same terms
as the first book.  At the same time the latter,
which was by now out of print, underwent some
material alterations and was re-published in a
new form.
</p>

<p>
The pictures for 1875 include <i>La Bella Mano</i>,
which represents a lady washing her "beautiful
hands" in a scalloped basin of brass; also some
of the studies for the <i>Blessed Damozel</i>, a finished
pen-and-ink study for a great picture of 1877,
the <i>Astarte Syriaca</i>, and a large pencil drawing
called <i>The Question</i> or <i>The Sphinx</i>.

</p>

<p>
The following year was mainly devoted to the
<i>Blessed Damozel</i>, an attempt to realize on canvas
Rossetti's early poem which first appeared in
"The Germ."  The picture is a very fine one.
Rossetti filled in the background behind the
stooping figure of the damozel with a heavenly
landscape, in which were countless pairs of
embracing lovers.  In 1877 he added a predella
representing the earthly lover gazing up through
space, and in 1879 he painted a replica, omitting
the background of lovers and substituting two
angel heads rather suggestive of those which
occur in <i>La Ghirlandata</i>.
</p>

<p>
The year 1877 contains but three items, two
of which are, however, the important oil-pictures
<i>Astarte Syriaca</i> and <i>The Sea-Spell</i>.  The third
was a <i>Magdalen</i> bearing the vase of spikenard.
</p>

<p>
<i>Astarte Syriaca</i> is a massive figure, with face
and hair strongly reminiscent of Mrs. Morris.  It
was bought at its first owner's death for the
Corporation Art Gallery of Manchester.
</p>

<p>
The two finished items of 1878&mdash;for as the
years advance the output grows less and less&mdash;are
<i>A Vision of Fiammetta</i> and a water-colour
study of a head called <i>Bruna Brunelleschi</i>.
<i>Fiammetta</i> is a fine and striking conception,
representing on a life-size scale the lady beloved
by Boccaccio, to whom he addressed the sonnet
which begins: "Round her red garland and her
golden hair, I saw a fire about Fiammetta's head."  The
sitter for <i>Fiammetta</i> was Mrs. W. J. Stillman.
</p>

<p>
<i>La Donna della Finestra</i> was painted in 1879.
This "Lady of the Window," also known as
"The Lady of Pity," is she who in Dante's "Vita
Nuova" is described as looking down upon the
poet one day when he was overcome with grief.
The head is taken from Mrs. Morris, much
modified by the conventions which Rossetti at this
time introduced into all his faces.  Not the least
charming feature of the picture is the clustering
mass of beautifully painted fig-leaves growing up
to the balcony in which the lady sits.
</p>

<p>
During 1880 and 1881 Rossetti was occupied
with three large pictures, <i>The Day Dream</i>, <i>The
Salutation of Beatrice</i>, and <i>La Pia</i>; with <i>Found</i>,
which had been re-commissioned by Mr. William
Graham; and with several replicas, of which the
most important was the smaller <i>Dante's Dream</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Day Dream</i> is a portrait of Mrs. Morris
seated in the lower branches of a sycamore tree.
<i>La Pia</i>, the last original picture painted by
Rossetti, depicts the story of Pia de' Tolomei,
told in the fifth canto of the "Purgatorio."  In
Rossetti's canvas she is seen, sitting forward in
a window, gazing out over the poisonous
Maremma from the fortress where her husband
had placed her to die.  <i>Found</i>, which was one of
the first pictures Rossetti attempted, was never
completed.  After Rossetti's death, as already
mentioned, Sir Edward Burne-Jones added a little
work to it, and in this condition it was taken over
by the purchaser.  It is now in America.
</p>

<p>
With this we come to an end of Rossetti's
work as a painter.  It remains briefly to close the
record of his life.
</p>

<p>
In September, 1881, Rossetti, accompanied
by Mr. Hall Caine, undertook an expedition to
the lake district of Cumberland; but after a
month his health, which at first had appeared to
benefit, became alarmingly bad, and he returned
hurriedly to London.  After a partial recovery
from this illness his work was once more
interrupted in December by an attack of nervous
paralysis, traceable to the effects of the drug he
had been taking.  In February, 1882, he was taken
to Birchington-on-Sea, where a cottage had been
placed at his disposal, and here he died on the
10th of April.  He was buried, quietly and simply,
in the little churchyard at Birchington, where a
stone monument has been erected by his family
in the form of a Celtic cross designed by Madox
Brown.  A memorial window embodying his own
early design of <i>The Passover</i>, adapted by
Mr. Shields, was also set up in the adjoining church.
</p>

<p>
So passed away, in the fifty-fourth year of his
life, one of the most original artists of our time;
I will not say one of the greatest painters, for that
would invite controversy as to points in which
he was, and knew himself to be, deficient.  But
as an artist, as one who saw, and could interpret
and depict beautiful things in a beautiful way,
there can be no two questions about Rossetti's
greatness.  Never before has one man blended so
perfectly the sister gifts of poetry and painting
that it was impossible to pronounce in which he
was superior.
</p>

<p>
To complain, as some have done, of the mediaeval
quality of his subjects is foolish.  As well
complain that fairy tales are old.  Rossetti was
mediaeval in his thoughts and tastes.  Without any
affectation or straining for effect he lived his
intellectual life in a mystical, richly-coloured world
of romantic knights and ladies.  These, and not
the hedgerows or buttercups of to-day, were
what came to the surface in his creative moods.
We have witnessed in these latter years a great
revival of romance, springing up in various ways
all over the continent of Europe.  Of this revival
in England, on the side of pictorial art, Rossetti
was the fountain head.  The gentle melancholy
that pervades his work was derived from his
namesake Dante, to whom he was doubly allied by
ties of birth and sentiment.  "He was moreover
driven by something like the same unrelaxing
stress and fervour of temperament, so that even
in middle age it seemed scarcely less true to
say of Rossetti than of Dante himself:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Like flame within the naked hand,<br>
  His body bore his burning heart.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The direction of his influence, and of the
Pre-Raphaelite movement generally, has been worked
out in a scholarly manner by Mr. Percy Bate, in
a book called "The English Pre-Raphaelite
Painters," where an attempt is made for the first
time to trace the artistic lineage of such diverse
executants as Mr. Spencer Stanhope, Mr. Walter
Crane, Mr. Strudwick, Mrs. de Morgan, Mr. Byam
Shaw, and others.  On many of these the
influence of Burne-Jones is more evident than
that of Rossetti; but Burne-Jones himself owed
much to Rossetti at the critical period of his
career.
</p>

<p>
The subject of Rossetti's art is one that presents
difficulty, on account of the semi-privacy which
surrounded it during the painter's lifetime.  The
subject of Rossetti himself is more difficult still.
It has become a sort of fashion to decry the
man, and to forget the genius, among some who
knew him only in his latest years&mdash;perhaps by
hearsay mainly.  Stories of his want of consideration
for others, his egotism, his shabby treatment
of patrons, his ungoverned temper, are
reeled off with a sort of zest, as though they
summed up the man.  But in Rossetti good and
bad were, as usual, inextricably mixed up, with
a strong preponderance towards the former.
There were periods when his brilliant, impulsive,
magnetic personality swamped the most audacious
faults.  For a man to stand out above his fellows
is often enough a signal for petty jealousy and
stone-throwing.  But in such cases, one may
remark, it is not always a David who prepares the
sling, nor is it always the giant who is on the side
of the Philistines.

<h3>
OUR ILLUSTRATIONS
</h3>

<p>
Rossetti's record as a painter divides
itself naturally into three periods, beginning
with a fairly numerous series of small
romantic water-colours, which to many people
represent the most charming, if not the most
mature, feature of his work.  The subjects for
these were selected largely from Browning, from
the "Vita Nuova" of Dante, and from the
Arthurian legends, themes which appealed
irresistibly to his imaginative mind, and which
formed a common link between the members of
the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the later
group of young Oxford men which included
William Morris and Burne-Jones.  Practically
the only oil pictures painted by Rossetti during
this period were the <i>Girlhood of Mary Virgin</i>,
and the little <i>Ecce Ancilla Domini</i>, now in the
Tate Gallery at Millbank.  This period came to
an end in 1862, with the death of Rossetti's wife,
and the beautiful <i>Beata Beatrix</i> (also in the
Tate Gallery) which was really a memorial of
her pure features, was followed by a number of
magnificent canvases painted from models of a
rich and sumptuous type, amongst which may be
specially mentioned <i>The Beloved</i>, <i>Monna Vanna</i>,
and <i>Sibylla Palmifera</i>, <i>Lady Lilith</i>, the <i>Venus
Verticordia</i>, <i>The Loving Cup</i>, <i>Veronica Veronese</i>,
<i>The Bower Meadow</i>, <i>La Ghirlandata</i>, <i>Sea Spell</i>,
and <i>La Bella Mano</i>.  Lastly comes a large group
of single figure subjects painted from, or based
on, the dark and almost exotic features of
Mrs. William Morris.  Of these may be named in
particular <i>Mariana</i>, <i>Pandora</i>, <i>Proserpine</i>, <i>Astarte
Syriaca</i>, <i>La Donna della Finestra</i>, <i>The Day
Dream</i>, and Rossetti's last finished picture <i>La
Pia</i>.
</p>

<p>
Owing to an invincible dislike for exhibitions,
and the secrecy which in consequence hung over
Rossetti's work, the two earlier groups were
hardly seen by the public at all until after his
death, and his fame, when it spread, was based
chiefly upon the large canvases of the latest
group, which may account for the very general
belief that Rossetti painted only from one type
of sitter, with somewhat exaggerated characteristics,
a further error which may be explained by
the mannerisms which undoubtedly beset him
towards the close of his life, when his health had
failed permanently and his eyesight was no longer
at its best.
</p>

<p>
Of the earliest pictures, painted for the most
part when Rossetti was little more than a boy,
the following are selected for illustration:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
(1) <i>Ecce Ancilla Domini</i>, which was exhibited
in 1850 and helped to bear the brunt of the
vigorous onslaught which was made in that year
upon the pictures of the newly formed
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.  There is nothing which
could possibly shock us now in the simple,
girl-like figure of Rossetti's Virgin, crouching in
half-awakened awe upon her pallet couch before
the grave-faced angel who is holding out to her
a lily.  In many ways it is a far more reverent
treatment of the scene than one is accustomed
to in old Italian canvases with their sumptuously
robed madonnas and angels gay with peacock-wings
and jewelled trappings.  The painting, too,
is a masterpiece for so young and inexperienced
an artist, full of skill in the handling of white
draperies and restrained in the use of colour.
The only bright notes in the picture are the
crimson cloth worked with a lily, upon a stand
at the foot of the bed, and the blue curtain at
its head.  Everything else is subdued and faint
with the clear light of an English, not an
Eastern, dawn, seen through the open window which
frames the golden head of the angel.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
(2) <i>The Blue Closet</i>.  This was painted in
1857, and formed one of a notable series of
small water-colours which once belonged to
William Morris.  Although neither Dantesque
nor Arthurian in subject, it is strongly akin to
the latter class in its feeling for mediaeval chivalry
and dress, and has been chosen because both in
colouring and composition it is one of the most
perfect examples of Rossetti's early work.  It
represents two queens, the one on the left in red
with green sleeves, and the one on the right in
crimson and gray, playing upon opposite sides
of an inlaid clavichord or dulcimer.  Two other
ladies stand behind them singing.  Blue tiles on
the wall and on the floor suggest the title, which
in its turn gave rise to one of William Morris's
poems.
</p>

<p>
The next illustration given, as typical of
Rossetti's intermediate period is&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
(3) <i>Beata Beatrix</i>, which was bequeathed to
the National Collection by Lady Mount Temple,
to whom it formerly belonged.  This is so well
known from reproductions that it is unnecessary
to describe it in detail, further than to say that
it represents symbolically the death of Beatrice
as set forth in the "Vita Nuova."  Beatrice is
not dead, but is seated on a balcony in a trance,
whilst standing a little way in the background
watching her are Dante and the figure of Love.
A crimson bird, the messenger of Death, is letting
fall a poppy into her lap.  Beatrice is robed in
pure green, such as Rossetti loved to paint, with
faint purple sleeves.  A dial marks the fateful
hour which was to bear her, on that 9th of June,
1290, "to be glorious under the banner of the
blessed Queen Mary."  On the frame, designed
by Rossetti himself, are the first words of the
lamentation from Jeremiah, <i>Quomodo sedet sola
civitas</i>: "How doth the city sit solitary that was
full of people."  There is a replica of this picture
in the Corporation Art Gallery of Birmingham,
but it was an unfinished one which was worked
on after Rossetti's death by Madox Brown.
</p>

<p>
Our next illustration is from a pen-and-ink
drawing, and is typical of a branch of work in
which Rossetti excelled almost as notably as
Burne-Jones.  It represents:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
(4) <i>Mary Magdalene at the house of Simon the
Pharisee</i>.  The date of this famous drawing is
1853, but it was not actually finished until some
years later.  The scene represents a procession
of revellers, amongst whom is the Magdalene
with her lover.  In passing the door of Simon
she sees within it the face of Christ, and striving
to leave her companions she tears off the garland
from her head and presses up the steps.  Christ
is watching her, and waits for her to reach him,
whilst the others try to bar her passage.  A young
doe is cropping the bush which grows against
the wall of the house.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
(5) <i>The Beloved</i>, painted in 1866, is probably
the most perfect of all Rossetti's pictures.  The
subject is the Bride of the Psalms advancing to
her lover.  "She shall be brought unto the king
in raiment of needlework; the virgins that be
her fellows shall bear her company."  In the
centre of the group is the bride, arrayed in such
gorgeous stuffs as only Rossetti could imagine,
of an indescribable green with flowing sleeves
gorgeously embroidered in gold and red.  On her
head is an ornament of scarlet oriental featherwork
which flashes like a jewel.  Four dark-haired
maidens accompany her, whose heads
form a frame to her own beauty, and in front a
little negro boy, with jewelled collar and headband,
bears a golden vase of roses.  The figures,
though life-size, are only painted half-length.  The
faces are not of the type usually associated with
Rossetti, and form a sufficient answer in
themselves to those who think that he never painted
from more than one model.  The bride's, in
particular, is a face of extraordinary beauty.  <i>The
Beloved</i> is one of a fine trio of pictures
commissioned by the late Mr. George Rae of
Birkenhead, the other two being <i>Monna Vanna</i>
and <i>Sibylla Palmifera</i>.  As stated already, they
represent Rossetti's prime, when his work was
technically at its best, and before his health had
broken down and driven him into forced or
morbid mannerisms.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
(6) <i>Mariana</i>.  This picture belongs to 1870, and
was at one time in the great Graham collection.
The title is taken from "Measure for Measure,"
and has no connection with Tennyson's poem.
It was begun originally in 1868, as a portrait of
Mrs. Morris, and in most essentials resembles the
beautiful picture lent by her to the Tate Gallery.
Rossetti discarded the canvas at the time in
favour of the latter version, but took it up again
afterwards, painted in the figure of the boy
singing, and gave it the Shakespeare name with
the legend from the page's song, "Take, O take
those lips away."  In the Tate picture Mrs. Morris
is seated at a table before a jar of roses;
here the lady is holding an embroidery frame,
but in each case she wears a gown of marvellous
blue with contrasting chains and jewels.

<br>
DANTE'S DREAM.
</p>

<p>
(7) <i>Dante's Dream</i>.  This, from its size and
on other grounds is regarded by many critics as
the most important of Rossetti's pictures.  It
is certainly the most popular, and if frequent
reproduction be any gauge, stands high amongst
all modern pictures in this respect.  Its painting
occupied the greater part of 1870 and 1871, and
was a great physical strain, so much so that in
the year following Rossetti suffered from a severe
break-down which permanently affected his
health.  The subject, and practically the composition
also, are the same as in a small water-colour
of 1856, and represents the vision related by Dante
in the "Vita Nuova" as having come to him of
Beatrice lying in death and angels bearing upward
her soul in the form of "an exceedingly white
cloud."  Love, in a flame-coloured robe, is leading
him up to the bier, and scarlet birds, typifying
love, are flying in and out of the house.  Two
handsome maidens, in flowing gowns of green,
are holding up the ends of the pall which covered
the bier, while Love bends down and kisses the
pale face of the dead lady.  Beyond the arched
doorway is seen a glimpse of Florence with the
Arno.  The picture when finished proved too large
for its owner's room, and changed hands more
than once before it finally found a resting-place
in the Walker Art Gallery at Liverpool.  Rossetti
painted a second rather smaller picture, to replace
it, and added two predellas to the subject.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
(8) <i>Astarte Syriaca</i> is a vision of the Syrian
Venus, massive and splendid in form, with vague
eyes typical of her mysteries.  She stands, facing
the spectator, in a robe of gorgeous green, which
half reveals the outlines of her body, clasping
with both hands her jewelled girdle.  On either
side behind her are attendant spirits bearing
torches.  The picture is a good example of
Rossetti's latest work.  It was commissioned by
the late Mr. Fry and painted in 1877.  It now
adorns the Corporation Art Gallery of Manchester.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
